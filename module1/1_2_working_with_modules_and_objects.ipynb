Therefore, we do NOT keep these books\\r\\nin compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\\r\\nof the official release dates, for time for better editing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\\r\\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\\r\\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\\r\\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.

To be sure you have an\\r\\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\\r\\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\\r\\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\\r\\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\\r\\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\\r\\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\\r\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\r\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\r\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\r\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\r\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\\r\\nfiles per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+\\r\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\r\\ntotal should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\r\\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\\r\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\r\\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\\r\\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\\r\\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\r\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Single, my dear, to be sure!  A single man of large\\r\\nfortune; four or five thousand a year.  What a fine thing for our\\r\\ngirls!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How so?  How can it affect them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so\\r\\n tiresome!  You must know that I am thinking of his marrying\\r\\none of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Design!  Nonsense, how can you talk so!  But it is very likely\\r\\nthat he MAY fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\\r\\nmust visit him as soon as he comes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see no occasion for that.  You and the girls may go, or you\\r\\nmay send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still\\r\\nbetter, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley\\r\\nmay like you the best of the party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, you flatter me.  I certainly HAVE had my share of\\r\\nbeauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\r\\nWhen a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give\\r\\nover thinking of her own beauty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think\\r\\nof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when\\r\\nhe comes into the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But consider your daughters.  Only think what an\\r\\nestablishment it would be for one of them.  Sir William and\\r\\nLady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for\\r\\nin general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you\\r\\nmust go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do\\r\\nnot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely.  I dare say Mr. Bingley will\\r\\nbe very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\\r\\nassure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\r\\nchooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for\\r\\n my little Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing.  Lizzy is not a bit better\\r\\nthan the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\\r\\nJane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\\r\\ngiving HER the preference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied\\r\\nhe; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\\r\\nsomething more of quickness than her sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how CAN you abuse your own children in such a\\r\\nway?  You take delight in vexing me.  You have no compassion\\r\\nfor my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mistake me, my dear.  I have a high respect for your\\r\\nnerves.  They are my old friends.  I have heard you mention\\r\\nthem with consideration these last twenty years at least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic\\r\\nhumour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-\\r\\ntwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand\\r\\nhis character.  HER mind was less difficult to develop.  She was\\r\\na woman of mean understanding, little information, and\\r\\nuncertain temper.  When she was discontented, she fancied\\r\\nherself nervous.  The business of her life was to get her\\r\\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\\r\\nalways assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\\r\\nevening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.  It\\r\\nwas then disclosed in the following manner: --Observing his\\r\\nsecond daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly\\r\\naddressed her with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not in a way to know WHAT Mr. Bingley likes,\" said\\r\\nher mother resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet\\r\\nhim at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.  She has two\\r\\nnieces of her own.  She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\\r\\nhave no opinion of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that\\r\\nyou do not depend on her serving you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to\\r\\ncontain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\\'s sake!  Have a little\\r\\ncompassion on my nerves.  You tear them to pieces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she\\r\\ntimes them ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully.\\r\\n\"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come\\r\\nback till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to\\r\\nintroduce him, for she will not know him herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\\r\\nintroduce Mr. Bingley to HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\\r\\nwith him myself; how can you be so teasing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I honour your circumspection.  A fortnight\\'s acquaintance is\\r\\ncertainly very little.  One cannot know what a man really is by\\r\\nthe end of a fortnight. But if WE do not venture somebody else\\r\\nwill; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their\\r\\nchance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if\\r\\nyou decline the office, I will take it on myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\\r\\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried\\r\\nhe.  \"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress\\r\\nthat is laid on them, as nonsense?  I cannot quite agree with you\\r\\nTHERE. What say you, Mary?  For you are a young lady of\\r\\ndeep reflection, I know, and read great books and make\\r\\nextracts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that\\r\\nbefore?  If I had known as much this morning I certainly would\\r\\nnot have called on him.  It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\\r\\npaid the visit; we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first\\r\\ntumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\\r\\nhad expected all the while.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!  But I knew I\\r\\nshould\\r\\npersuade you at last.  I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\r\\nneglect such an acquaintance.  Well, how pleased I am! and it is\\r\\nsuch a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning\\r\\nand never said a word about it till now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said Mr.\\r\\nBennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\r\\nraptures of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat an excellent father you have, girls!\" said she, when the\\r\\ndoor was shut.  \"I do not know how you will ever make him\\r\\namends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter.  At our\\r\\ntime of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\r\\nacquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\r\\nanything.  Lydia, my love, though you ARE the youngest, I dare\\r\\nsay Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I AM the\\r\\nyoungest, I\\'m the tallest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\\r\\nwould return Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and determining when they\\r\\nshould ask him to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\r\\nfive daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\r\\nfrom her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\r\\nThey attacked him in various way-- with barefaced questions,\\r\\ningenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\r\\nskill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the\\r\\nsecond-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.  Her\\r\\nreport was highly favourable.  Sir William had been delighted\\r\\nwith him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome,\\r\\nextremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be\\r\\nat the next assembly with a large party.  Nothing could be more\\r\\ndelightful!  To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards\\r\\nfalling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\\'s heart\\r\\nwere entertained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\r\\nNetherfield,\" said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the\\r\\nothers equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and sat\\r\\nabout ten minutes with him in his library.  He had entertained\\r\\nhopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of\\r\\nwhose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.\\r\\nThe ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the\\r\\nadvantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore\\r\\na blue coat, and rode a black horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\r\\nalready had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\r\\ncredit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which\\r\\ndeferred it all.  Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the\\r\\nfollowing day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour\\r\\nof their invitation, etc.  Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.\\r\\nShe could not imagine what business he could have in town so\\r\\nsoon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear\\r\\nthat he might be always flying about from one place to another,\\r\\nand never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas\\r\\nquieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone\\r\\nto London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report\\r\\nsoon followed, that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\\r\\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly.  The girls grieved\\r\\nover such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day\\r\\nbefore the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought\\r\\nonly six with him from London-- his five sisters and a cousin.\\r\\nAnd when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of\\r\\nonly five altogether-- Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband\\r\\nof the eldest, and another young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a\\r\\npleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.  His\\r\\nsisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.  His\\r\\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but\\r\\nhis friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by\\r\\nhis fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the\\r\\nreport which was in general circulation within five minutes\\r\\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The\\r\\ngentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the\\r\\nladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and\\r\\nhe was looked at with great admiration for about half the\\r\\nevening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of\\r\\nhis popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above\\r\\nhis company, and above being pleased; and not all his large\\r\\nestate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\r\\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to\\r\\nbe compared with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\r\\nprincipal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\r\\ndanced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,\\r\\nand talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.  Such amiable\\r\\nqualities must speak for themselves.  What a contrast between\\r\\nhim and his friend!  Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.\\r\\nHurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced\\r\\nto any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking\\r\\nabout the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\r\\nHis character was decided.  He was the proudest, most\\r\\ndisagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he\\r\\nwould never come there again.  Amongst the most violent\\r\\nagainst him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general\\r\\nbehaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\r\\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of\\r\\ngentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that\\r\\ntime, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear\\r\\na conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from\\r\\nthe dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance.  I hate to see\\r\\nyou standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.  You had\\r\\nmuch better dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly shall not.  You know how I detest it, unless I am\\r\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner.  At such an assembly as\\r\\nthis it would be insupportable.  Your sisters are engaged, and\\r\\nthere is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\r\\npunishment to me to stand up with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley,\\r\\n\"for a kingdom!  Upon my honour, I never met with so many\\r\\npleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are\\r\\nseveral of them you see uncommonly pretty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!  But\\r\\nthere is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is\\r\\nvery pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my\\r\\npartner to introduce you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a\\r\\nmoment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own\\r\\nand coldly said:  \"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to\\r\\ntempt ME; I am in no humour at present to give consequence\\r\\nto young ladies who are slighted by other men.  You had better\\r\\nreturn to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting\\r\\nyour time with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\r\\nElizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.\\r\\nShe told the story, however, with great spirit among her\\r\\nfriends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted\\r\\nin anything ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole\\r\\nfamily.  Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much\\r\\nadmired by the Netherfield party.  Mr. Bingley had danced with\\r\\nher twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane\\r\\nwas as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in\\r\\na quieter way.  Elizabeth felt Jane\\'s pleasure.  Mary had heard\\r\\nherself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished\\r\\ngirl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\r\\nfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all\\r\\nthat they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.  They returned,\\r\\ntherefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they\\r\\nlived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.  They\\r\\nfound Mr. Bennet still up.  With a book he was regardless of\\r\\ntime; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of\\r\\ncuriosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such\\r\\nsplendid expectations.  He had rather hoped that his wife\\'s\\r\\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon\\r\\nfound out that he had a different story to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have\\r\\nhad a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.  I wish you\\r\\nhad been there.  Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\r\\nEverybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought\\r\\nher quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!  Only think of\\r\\nTHAT, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was\\r\\nthe only creature in the room that he asked a second time.\\r\\nFirst of all, he asked Miss Lucas.  I was so vexed to see him\\r\\nstand up with her!  But, however, he did not admire her at all;\\r\\nindeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with\\r\\nJane as she was going down the dance.  So he inquired who she\\r\\nwas, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.  Then\\r\\nthe two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with\\r\\n Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two\\r\\nsixth with Lizzy, and the BOULANGER--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he had had any compassion for ME,\" cried her husband\\r\\nimpatiently, \"he would not have danced half so much!  For God\\'s\\r\\nsake, say no more of his partners.  O that he had\\r\\nsprained his ankle in the first place!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him.  He is so\\r\\nexcessively handsome!  And his sisters are charming women.  I\\r\\nnever in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.  I\\r\\ndare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst\\'s gown--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere she was interrupted again.  Mr. Bennet protested against\\r\\nany description of finery.  She was therefore obliged to seek\\r\\nanother branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness\\r\\nof spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose\\r\\nmuch by not suiting HIS fancy; for he is a most disagreeable,\\r\\nhorrid man, not at all worth pleasing.  So high and so conceited\\r\\nthat there was no enduring him!  He walked here, and he\\r\\nwalked there, fancying himself so very great!  Not handsome\\r\\nenough to dance with!  I wish you had been there, my dear, to\\r\\nhave given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\r\\ncautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\r\\nsister just how very much she admired him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible,\\r\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--\\r\\nso much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man\\r\\nought likewise to be, if he possibly can.  His character is thereby\\r\\ncomplete.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\\r\\ntime.  I did not expect such a compliment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not you? I did for you.  But that is one great difference\\r\\nbetween us.  Compliments always take YOU by surprise, and\\r\\nME never.  What could be more natural than his asking you\\r\\nagain?  He could not help seeing that you were about five times\\r\\nas pretty as every other woman in the room.  No thanks to his\\r\\ngallantry for that.  Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I\\r\\ngive you leave to like him.  You have liked many a stupider\\r\\nperson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\r\\ngeneral.  You never see a fault in anybody.  All the world are\\r\\ngood and agreeable in your eyes.  I never heard you speak ill of\\r\\na human being in your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always\\r\\nspeak what I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you do; and it is THAT which makes the wonder.  With\\r\\nYOUR good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\\r\\nnonsense of others!  Affectation of candour is common enough--\\r\\none meets with it everywhere.  But to be candid without\\r\\nostentation or design-- to take the good of everybody\\'s\\r\\ncharacter and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--\\r\\nbelongs to you alone.  And so you like this man\\'s sisters, too, do\\r\\nyou?  Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not-- at first.  But they are very pleasing women when\\r\\nyou converse with them.  Miss Bingley is to live with her\\r\\nbrother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall\\r\\nnot find a very charming neighbour in her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\r\\nbehaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\r\\ngeneral; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\r\\nof temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by\\r\\nany attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\r\\nthem.  They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\r\\nhumour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making\\r\\nthemselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\\r\\nconceited.  They were rather handsome, had been educated in\\r\\none of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of\\r\\ntwenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more\\r\\nthan they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and\\r\\nwere therefore in every respect entitled to think well of\\r\\nthemselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable\\r\\nfamily in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\\r\\nimpressed on their memories than that their brother\\'s fortune\\r\\nand their own had been acquired by trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a\\r\\nhundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to\\r\\npurchase an estate, but did not live to do it.  Mr. Bingley\\r\\nintended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county;\\r\\nbut as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of\\r\\na manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the\\r\\neasiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\r\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next\\r\\ngeneration to purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\\r\\nthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\r\\nwas by no means unwilling to preside at his table-- nor was Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\r\\ndisposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\r\\nMr. Bingley had not been or age two years, when he was tempted\\r\\nby an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.\\r\\nHe did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour-- was pleased with\\r\\nthe situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the\\r\\nowner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\r\\nspite of great opposition of character.  Bingley was endeared to\\r\\nDarcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\r\\nthough no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\r\\nand though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.  On the\\r\\nstrength of Darcy\\'s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\r\\nof his judgement the highest opinion.  In understanding, Darcy\\r\\nwas the superior.  Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy\\r\\nwas clever.  He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\r\\nfastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\\r\\nIn that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.  Bingley was\\r\\nsure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\r\\ngiving offense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\r\\nsufficiently characteristic.  Bingley had never met with more\\r\\npleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\r\\nmost kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\r\\nstiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as\\r\\nto Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\r\\nDarcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\r\\nthere was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\r\\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention\\r\\nor pleasure.  Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she\\r\\nsmiled too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so-- but still they\\r\\nadmired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet\\r\\ngirl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.\\r\\nMiss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their\\r\\nbrother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as\\r\\nhe chose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom\\r\\nthe Bennets were particularly intimate.  Sir William Lucas had\\r\\nbeen formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a\\r\\ntolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an\\r\\naddress to the king during his mayoralty.  The distinction had\\r\\nperhaps been felt too strongly.  It had given him a disgust to\\r\\nhis business, and to his residence in a small market town; and,\\r\\nin quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a\\r\\nhouse about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that\\r\\nperiod Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his\\r\\nown importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself\\r\\nsolely in being civil to all the world.  For, though elated by his\\r\\nrank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was\\r\\nall attention to everybody.  By nature inoffensive, friendly, and\\r\\nobliging, his presentation at St. James\\'s had made him\\r\\ncourteous.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to\\r\\nbe a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.  They had several\\r\\nchildren.  The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young\\r\\nwoman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth\\'s intimate friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to\\r\\ntalk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after\\r\\nthe assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\r\\ncommunicate. \"YOU began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.  \"YOU\\r\\nwere Mr. Bingley\\'s first choice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her\\r\\ntwice. To be sure that DID seem as if he admired her-- indeed I\\r\\nrather believe he DID-- I heard something about it-- but I\\r\\nhardly know what-- something about Mr. Robinson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.\\r\\nRobinson; did not I mention it to you?  Mr. Robinson\\'s asking\\r\\nhim how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did\\r\\nnot think there were a great many pretty women in the room,\\r\\nand WHICH he thought the prettiest? and his answering\\r\\nimmediately to the last question:  \\'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\\r\\nbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word!  Well, that is very decided indeed-- that does\\r\\nseem as if-- but, however, it may all come to nothing, you\\r\\nknow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY overhearings were more to the purpose than YOURS,\\r\\nEliza,\" said Charlotte.  \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth\\r\\nlistening to as his friend, is he?-- poor Eliza!-- to be only just\\r\\nTOLERABLE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by\\r\\nhis ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it\\r\\nwould be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.  Mrs. Long\\r\\ntold me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour\\r\\nwithout once opening his lips.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you quite sure, ma\\'am?-- is not there a little mistake?\"\\r\\nsaid Jane.  \"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield,\\r\\nand he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed\\r\\nquite angry at being spoke to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much,\\r\\nunless among his intimate acquaintances.  With THEM he is\\r\\nremarkably agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.  If he had been so very\\r\\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.  But I can guess\\r\\nhow it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I\\r\\ndare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep\\r\\na carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas,\\r\\n\"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance\\r\\nwith HIM, if I were you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe, ma\\'am, I may safely promise you NEVER to dance\\r\\nwith him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend ME so much as\\r\\npride often does, because there is an excuse for it.  One cannot\\r\\nwonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\r\\neverything in his favour, should think highly of himself.  If I\\r\\nmay so express it, he has a RIGHT to be proud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily\\r\\nforgive HIS pride, if he had not mortified MINE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity\\r\\nof her reflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe. By all\\r\\nthat I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\r\\nindeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\r\\nthere are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\r\\nself-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\r\\nimaginary.  Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\r\\nwords are often used synonymously.  A person may be proud\\r\\nwithout being vain.  Pride relates more to our opinion of\\r\\nourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who\\r\\ncame with his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was.  I\\r\\nwould keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a\\r\\nday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\r\\nyour bottle directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\\r\\nthat she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.\\r\\nThe visit was soon returned in due form.  Miss Bennet\\'s\\r\\npleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\r\\nBingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable,\\r\\nand the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of\\r\\nbeing better acquainted with THEM was expressed towards\\r\\nthe two eldest.  By Jane, this attention was received with the\\r\\ngreatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in\\r\\ntheir treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister,\\r\\nand could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it\\r\\nwas, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence\\r\\nof their brother\\'s admiration.  It was generally evident\\r\\nwhenever they met, that he DID admire her and to HER it was\\r\\nequally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which\\r\\nshe had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\r\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure\\r\\nthat it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general,\\r\\nsince Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure\\r\\nof temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would\\r\\nguard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.  She\\r\\nmentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to\\r\\nimpose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\r\\ndisadvantage to be so very guarded.  If a woman conceals her\\r\\naffection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\r\\nthe opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\r\\nconsolation to believe the world equally in the dark.  There is\\r\\nso much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that\\r\\nit is not safe to leave any to itself.  We can all BEGIN freely-- a\\r\\nslight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\r\\nwho have heart enough to be really in love without\\r\\nencouragement.  In nine cases out of ten a women had better\\r\\nshow MORE affection than she feels.  Bingley, likes your\\r\\nsister, undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if\\r\\nshe does not help him on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.  If\\r\\nI can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton,\\r\\nindeed, not to discover it too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as\\r\\nyou do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\r\\nconceal it, he must find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.  But, though\\r\\nBingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many\\r\\nhours together; and, as they always see each other in large\\r\\nmixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be\\r\\nemployed in conversing together.  Jane should therefore make\\r\\nthe most of every half-hour in which she can command his\\r\\nattention.  When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure\\r\\nfor falling in love as much as she chooses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is\\r\\nin question but the desire of being well married, and if I were\\r\\ndetermined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\r\\nshould adopt it.  But these are not Jane\\'s feelings; she is not\\r\\nacting by design.  As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\r\\ndegree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness.  She has\\r\\nknown him only a fortnight.  She danced four dances with him\\r\\nat Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and\\r\\nhas since dined with him in company four times. This is not\\r\\nquite enough to make her understand his character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him, she\\r\\nmight only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\r\\nyou must remember that four evenings have also been spent\\r\\ntogether-- and four evenings may do a great deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\r\\nthey both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect\\r\\nto any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much\\r\\nhas been unfolded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart;\\r\\nand if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she\\r\\nhad as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying\\r\\nhis character for a twelvemonth.  Happiness in marriage is\\r\\nentirely  a matter of chance.  If the dispositions of the parties are\\r\\never so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand,\\r\\nit does not advance their felicity in the least.  They always\\r\\ncontinue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their\\r\\nshare of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of\\r\\nthe defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.  You know\\r\\nit is not sound, and that you would never act in this way\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\\'s attentions to her sister,\\r\\nElizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\r\\nan object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\r\\nher without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\r\\nlooked at her only to criticise.  But no sooner had he made it\\r\\nclear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature\\r\\nin her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly\\r\\nintelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.  To this\\r\\ndiscovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.  Though he\\r\\nhad detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect\\r\\nsymmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure\\r\\nto be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her\\r\\nmanners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught\\r\\nby their easy playfulness.  Of this she was perfectly unaware; to\\r\\nher he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere,\\r\\nand who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\r\\nconversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\r\\nothers.  His doing so drew her notice.  It was at Sir William\\r\\nLucas\\'s, where a large party were assembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by\\r\\nlistening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\\r\\nsee what he is about.  He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not\\r\\nbegin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without\\r\\nseeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied\\r\\nher friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately\\r\\nprovoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself\\r\\nuncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster\\r\\nto give us a ball at Meryton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\r\\nenergetic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are severe on us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will be HER turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas.  \"I\\r\\nam going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what\\r\\nfollows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!-- always\\r\\nwanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!  If\\r\\nmy vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been\\r\\ninvaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before\\r\\nthose who must be in the habit of hearing the very best\\r\\nperformers.\"  On Miss Lucas\\'s persevering, however, she added,\\r\\n\"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\"  And gravely glancing at Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\\r\\ncourse familiar with:  \\'Keep your breath to cool your porridge\\';\\r\\nand I shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.\\r\\nAfter a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties\\r\\nof several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded\\r\\nat the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence\\r\\nof being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for\\r\\nknowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for\\r\\ndisplay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\r\\nher application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\r\\nconceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\r\\nexcellence than she had reached.  Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\r\\nhad been listened to with much more pleasure, though not\\r\\nplaying half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto,\\r\\nwas glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish\\r\\nairs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the\\r\\nLucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at\\r\\none end of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode\\r\\nof passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\r\\nwas too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir\\r\\nWilliam Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as\\r\\none of the first refinements of polished society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\r\\namongst the less polished societies of the world.  Every savage\\r\\ncan dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William only smiled.  \"Your friend performs delightfully,\" he\\r\\ncontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \"and I\\r\\ndoubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\\r\\nsight.  Do you often dance at St. James\\'s?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the\\r\\nplace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself-- for I am\\r\\nfond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the\\r\\nair of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\\r\\ndisposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\\r\\ntowards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very\\r\\ngallant thing, and called out to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?  Mr. Darcy, you\\r\\nmust allow me to present this young lady to you as a very\\r\\ndesirable partner.  You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when\\r\\nso much beauty is before you.\"  And, taking her hand, he would\\r\\nhave given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised,\\r\\nwas not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back,\\r\\nand said with some discomposure to Sir William:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.  I entreat\\r\\nyou not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a\\r\\npartner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the\\r\\nhonour of her hand, but in vain.  Elizabeth was determined; nor\\r\\ndid Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\\r\\npersuasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to\\r\\ndeny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman\\r\\ndislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I\\r\\nam sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\\r\\nEliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance-- for who would\\r\\nobject to such a partner?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away.  Her resistance had\\r\\nnot injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her\\r\\nwith some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should imagine not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass\\r\\nmany evenings in this manner-- in such society; and indeed I am\\r\\nquite of you opinion.  I was never more annoyed!  The insipidity,\\r\\nand yet the noise-- the nothingness, and yet the self-importance\\r\\nof all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on\\r\\nthem!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.  My mind was\\r\\nmore agreeably engaged.  I have been meditating on the very\\r\\ngreat pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty\\r\\nwoman can bestow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, a desired he\\r\\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such\\r\\nreflections.  Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley.  \"I am all\\r\\nastonishment.  How long has she been such a favourite?-- and\\r\\npray, when am I to wish you joy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.  A\\r\\nlady\\'s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to\\r\\nlove, from love to matrimony, in a moment.  I knew you would\\r\\nbe wishing me joy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is\\r\\nabsolutely settled.  You will be having a charming\\r\\nmother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at\\r\\nPemberley with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to\\r\\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced\\r\\nher that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of\\r\\ntwo thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was\\r\\nentailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their\\r\\nmother\\'s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could\\r\\nbut ill supply the deficiency of his.  Her father had been an\\r\\nattorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk\\r\\nto their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother\\r\\nsettled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a\\r\\nmost convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually\\r\\ntempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to\\r\\ntheir aunt and to a milliner\\'s shop just over the way.  The two\\r\\nyoungest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly\\r\\nfrequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than\\r\\ntheir sisters\\', and when nothing better offered, a walk to\\r\\nMeryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and\\r\\nfurnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\\r\\nthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\\r\\nsome from their aunt.  At present, indeed, they were well\\r\\nsupplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of\\r\\na militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the\\r\\nwhole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most\\r\\ninteresting intelligence.  Every day added something to their\\r\\nknowledge of the officers\\' names and connections.  Their\\r\\nlodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to\\r\\nknow the officers themselves.  Mr. Phillips visited them all, and\\r\\nthis opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before.\\r\\nThey could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\\'s large\\r\\nfortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother,\\r\\nwas worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\\r\\nan ensign.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\r\\nBennet coolly observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must\\r\\nbe two of the silliest girls in the country.  I have suspected it\\r\\nsome time, but I am now convinced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia,\\r\\nwith perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of\\r\\nCaptain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the\\r\\nday, as he was going the next morning to London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you should\\r\\nbe so ready to think your own children silly.  If I wished to think\\r\\nslightingly of anybody\\'s children, it should not be of my own,\\r\\nhowever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not\\r\\nagree.  I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every\\r\\nparticular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\\r\\nyoungest daughters uncommonly foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have\\r\\nthe sense of their father and mother.  When they get to our age, I\\r\\ndare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\\r\\nI remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--\\r\\nand, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young\\r\\ncolonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my\\r\\ngirls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster\\r\\nlooked very becoming the other night at Sir William\\'s in his\\r\\nregimentals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and\\r\\nCaptain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\\'s as they did\\r\\nwhen they first came; she sees them now very often standing in\\r\\nClarke\\'s library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the\\r\\nfootman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield,\\r\\nand the servant waited for an answer.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s eyes\\r\\nsparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while\\r\\nher daughter read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from?  What is it about?  What does he\\r\\nsay?  Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,--\\r\\n     \"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with\\r\\nLouisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for\\r\\nthe rest of our lives, for a whole day\\'s tete-a-tete between two\\r\\nwomen can never end without a quarrel.  Come as soon as you\\r\\ncan on receipt of this.  My brother and the gentlemen are to dine\\r\\nwith the officers.-- Yours ever,\\r\\n                                             \"CAROLINE BINGLEY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia.  \"I wonder my aunt did not tell\\r\\nus of THAT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\\r\\nlikely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were\\r\\nsure that they would not offer to send her home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\\'s chaise to go to\\r\\nMeryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\\r\\nThey are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my mother\\'s\\r\\npurpose will be answered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that\\r\\nthe horses were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on\\r\\nhorseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many\\r\\ncheerful prognostics of a bad day.  Her hopes were answered;\\r\\nJane had not been gone long before it rained hard.  Her sisters\\r\\nwere uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.  The rain\\r\\ncontinued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly\\r\\ncould not some back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet more\\r\\nthan once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.  Till\\r\\nthe next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity\\r\\nof her contrivance.  Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant\\r\\nfrom Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--\\r\\n     \"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I\\r\\nsuppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.\\r\\nMy kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better.\\r\\nThey insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones-- therefore do not be\\r\\nalarmed if you should hear of his having been to me-- and,\\r\\nexcepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\\r\\nmatter with me.-- Yours, etc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the\\r\\nnote aloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of\\r\\nillness-- if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it\\r\\nwas all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying.  People do not die of little\\r\\ntrifling colds.  She will be taken good care of.  As long as she\\r\\nstays there, it is all very well.  I would go an see her if I could\\r\\nhave the carriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\\r\\nthough the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\\r\\nhorsewoman, walking was her only alternative.  She declared her\\r\\nresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such\\r\\na thing, in all this dirt!  You will not be fit to be seen when you\\r\\nget there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane-- which is all I want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the horses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\\r\\nnothing when one has a motive; only three miles.  I shall be back\\r\\nby dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but\\r\\nevery impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\\r\\nopinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\\r\\nrequired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and\\r\\nLydia.  Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\\r\\nladies set off together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps\\r\\nwe may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the\\r\\nlodgings of one of the officers\\' wives, and Elizabeth continued\\r\\nher walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping\\r\\nover stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity,\\r\\nand finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\\r\\nankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\\r\\nexercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane\\r\\nwere assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal\\r\\nof surprise.  That she should have walked three miles so early in\\r\\nthe day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost\\r\\nincredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nconvinced that they held her in contempt for it.  She was\\r\\nreceived, however, very politely by them; and in their brother\\'s\\r\\nmanners there was something better than politeness; there was\\r\\ngood humour and kindness.  Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\\r\\nHurst nothing at all.  The former was divided between\\r\\nadmiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her\\r\\ncomplexion, and doubt as to the occasion\\'s justifying her coming\\r\\nso far alone.  The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\\r\\nMiss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\\r\\nnot well enough to leave her room.  Elizabeth was glad to be\\r\\ntaken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld\\r\\nby the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in\\r\\nher note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at\\r\\nher entrance.  She was not equal, however, to much\\r\\nconversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could\\r\\nattempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\\r\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with.  Elizabeth silently\\r\\nattended her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and\\r\\nElizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\\r\\naffection and solicitude they showed for Jane.  The apothecary\\r\\ncame, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\\r\\nsupposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\\r\\nendeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\\r\\nand promised her some draughts.  The advice was followed\\r\\nreadily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached\\r\\nacutely.  Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\\r\\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had,\\r\\nin fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\\r\\nvery unwillingly said so.  Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\\r\\nand she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\\r\\ntestified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\\r\\nobliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\\r\\nremain at Netherfield for the present.  Elizabeth most thankfully\\r\\nconsented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to\\r\\nacquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of\\r\\nclothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt five o\\'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\\r\\nsix Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.  To the civil inquiries\\r\\nwhich then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure\\r\\nof distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nshe could not make a very favourable answer.  Jane was by no\\r\\nmeans better.  The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\\r\\ntimes how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have\\r\\na bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill\\r\\nthemselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\r\\nindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them\\r\\nrestored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\\r\\ncould regard with any complacency.  His anxiety for Jane was\\r\\nevident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\\r\\nprevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she\\r\\nbelieved she was considered by the others. She had very little\\r\\nnotice from any but him.  Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom\\r\\nElizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat,\\r\\ndrink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a\\r\\nplain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\\r\\nBingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.\\r\\nHer manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture\\r\\nof pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no\\r\\nbeauty.  Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\\r\\nexcellent walker.  I shall never forget her appearance this\\r\\nmorning.  She really looked almost wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did, indeed, Louisa.  I could hardly keep my countenance.\\r\\nVery nonsensical to come at all!  Why must SHE be scampering\\r\\nabout the country, because her sister had a cold?  Her hair, so\\r\\nuntidy, so blowsy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches\\r\\ndeep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had\\r\\nbeen let down to hide it not doing its office.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but\\r\\nthis was all lost upon me.  I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\r\\nlooked remarkably well when she came into the room this\\r\\nmorning.  Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley;\\r\\n\"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see\\r\\nYOUR sister make such an exhibition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it\\r\\nis, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!  What could\\r\\nshe mean by it?  It seems to me to show an abominable sort of\\r\\nconceited independence, a most country-town indifference to\\r\\ndecorum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\\r\\nBingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half\\r\\nwhisper, \"that this adventure has rather affected your\\r\\nadmiration of her fine eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"\\r\\nA short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a\\r\\nvery sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well\\r\\nsettled.  But with such a father and mother, and such low\\r\\nconnections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on\\r\\nMeryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near\\r\\nCheapside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed\\r\\nheartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside,\" cried\\r\\nBingley, \"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men\\r\\nof any consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it\\r\\ntheir hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the\\r\\nexpense of their dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her\\r\\nroom on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till\\r\\nsummoned to coffee.  She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth\\r\\nwould not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had\\r\\nthe comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather\\r\\nright than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.  On\\r\\nentering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and\\r\\nwas immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be\\r\\nplaying high, she declined it, for the short time she could stay\\r\\nbelow, with a book.  Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather\\r\\nsingular.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a\\r\\ngreat reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"I am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\"said\\r\\nBingley; \"and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite\\r\\nwell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards\\r\\nthe table where a few books were lying.  He immediately offered\\r\\nto fetch her others-- all that his library afforded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my\\r\\nown credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many,\\r\\nI have more than I ever looked into.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with\\r\\nthose in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should\\r\\nhave left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library\\r\\nyou have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\\r\\ngenerations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are\\r\\nalways buying books.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days\\r\\nas these.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neglect!  I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\\r\\nbeauties of that noble place.  Charles, when you build YOUR\\r\\nhouse, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\r\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.  There\\r\\nis not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\r\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her\\r\\nvery little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside,\\r\\nshe drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.\\r\\nBingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think she will.  She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s\\r\\nheight, or rather taller.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who\\r\\ndelighted me so much.  Such a countenance, such manners!  And\\r\\nso extremely accomplished for her age!  Her performance on the\\r\\npianoforte is exquisite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have\\r\\npatience to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you\\r\\nmean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think.  They all paint tables, cover screens,\\r\\nand net purses.  I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this,\\r\\nand I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first\\r\\ntime, without being informed that she was very accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a\\r\\nwoman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or\\r\\ncovering a screen.  But I am very far from agreeing with you in\\r\\nyour estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing\\r\\nmore than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance,\\r\\nthat are really accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal\\r\\nin your idea of an accomplished woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\\r\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is\\r\\nusually met with.  A woman must have a thorough knowledge of\\r\\nmusic, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to\\r\\ndeserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain\\r\\nsomething in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her\\r\\nvoice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but\\r\\nhalf-deserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she\\r\\nmust yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of\\r\\nher mind by extensive reading.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six\\r\\naccomplished women.  I rather wonder now at your knowing\\r\\nANY.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the\\r\\npossibility of all this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw such a woman.  I never saw such capacity, and\\r\\ntaste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice\\r\\nof her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew\\r\\nmany women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst\\r\\ncalled them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention\\r\\nto what was going forward.  As all conversation was thereby at\\r\\nan end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was\\r\\nclosed on her, \"is one of those young ladies who seek to\\r\\nrecommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their\\r\\nown; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.  But, in my\\r\\nopinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly\\r\\naddressed, \"there is a meanness in ALL the arts which ladies\\r\\nsometimes condescend to employ for captivation.  Whatever\\r\\nbears affinity to cunning is despicable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\r\\ncontinue the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\\r\\nworse, and that she could not leave her.  Bingley urged Mr.\\r\\nJones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced\\r\\nthat no country advice could be of any service, recommended an\\r\\nexpress to town for one of the most eminent physicians.  This\\r\\nshe would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply\\r\\nwith their brother\\'s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones\\r\\nshould be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not\\r\\ndecidedly better.  Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\r\\ndeclared that they were miserable:  They solaced their\\r\\nwretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could\\r\\nfind no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper\\r\\ndirections that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and\\r\\nher sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\\'s room, and\\r\\nin the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable\\r\\nanswer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr.\\r\\nBingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two\\r\\nelegant ladies who waited on his sisters.  In spite of this\\r\\namendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to\\r\\nLongbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own\\r\\njudgement of her situation.  The note was immediately\\r\\ndispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached\\r\\nNetherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would\\r\\nhave been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that\\r\\nher illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering\\r\\nimmediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove\\r\\nher from Netherfield.  She would not listen, therefore, to her\\r\\ndaughter\\'s proposal of being carried home; neither did the\\r\\napothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all\\r\\nadvisable.  After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\r\\nBingley\\'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three\\r\\ndaughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour.  Bingley met\\r\\nthem with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet\\r\\nworse than she expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill\\r\\nto be moved.  Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.\\r\\nWe must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley.  \"It must not be thought of.  My\\r\\nsister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon it, madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold\\r\\ncivility, \"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention\\r\\nwhile she remains with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do\\r\\nnot know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,\\r\\nand suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the\\r\\nworld, which is always the way with her, for she has, without\\r\\nexception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with.  I often tell\\r\\nmy other girls they are nothing to HER. You have a sweet room\\r\\nhere, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel\\r\\nwalk.  I do not know a place in the country that is equal to\\r\\nNetherfield.  You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope,\\r\\nthough you have but a short lease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\\r\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in\\r\\nfive minutes.  At present, however, I consider myself as quite\\r\\nfixed here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning\\r\\ntowards her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- I understand you perfectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily\\r\\nseen through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is as it happens.  It does not follow that a deep, intricate\\r\\ncharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not\\r\\nrun on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that\\r\\nyour were a studier of character.  It must be an amusing study.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing.  They\\r\\nhave at least that advantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few\\r\\nsubjects for such a study.  In a country neighbourhood you move\\r\\nin a very confined and unvarying society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something\\r\\nnew to be observed in them for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of\\r\\nmentioning a country neighbourhood.  \"I assure you there is\\r\\nquite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a\\r\\nmoment, turned silently away.  Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she\\r\\nhad gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the\\r\\ncountry, for my part, except the shops and public places.  The\\r\\ncountry is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it;\\r\\nand when I am in town it is pretty much the same.  They have\\r\\neach their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- that is because you have the right disposition.  But that\\r\\ngentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was\\r\\nnothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for\\r\\nher mother.  \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.  He only meant that\\r\\nthere was not such a variety of people to be met with in the\\r\\ncountry as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be\\r\\ntrue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not\\r\\nmeeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there\\r\\nare few neighbourhoods larger.  I know we dine with\\r\\nfour-and-twenty families.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep\\r\\nhis countenance.  His sister was less delicate, and directed her\\r\\neyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nfor the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\\'s\\r\\nthoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at\\r\\nLongbourn since HER coming away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.  What an agreeable\\r\\nman Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he?  So much the man of\\r\\nfashion!  So genteel and easy!  He had always something to say\\r\\nto everybody.  THAT is my idea of good breeding; and those\\r\\npersons who fancy themselves very important, and never open\\r\\ntheir mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, she would go home.  I fancy she was wanted about\\r\\nmince-pies.  For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants\\r\\nthat can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up very\\r\\ndifferently.  But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the\\r\\nLucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you.  It is a pity\\r\\nthey are not handsome!  Not that I think Charlotte so VERY\\r\\nplain-- but then she is our particular friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nherself has often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty.  I do not\\r\\nlike to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane-- one does\\r\\nnot often see anybody better looking.  It is what everybody says.\\r\\nI do not trust my own partiality.  When she was only fifteen,\\r\\nthere was a man at my brother Gardiner\\'s in town so much in\\r\\nlove with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her\\r\\nan offer before we came away.  But, however, he did not.\\r\\nPerhaps he thought her too young.  However, he wrote some\\r\\nverses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently.  \"There\\r\\nhas been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.  I\\r\\nwonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving\\r\\naway love!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love,\" said\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of  a fine, stout, healthy love it may.  Everything nourishes\\r\\nwhat is strong already.  But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\\r\\ninclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\\r\\nentirely away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made\\r\\nElizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself\\r\\nagain.  She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;\\r\\nand after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\\r\\ntroubling him also with Lizzy.  Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly\\r\\ncivil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,\\r\\nand say what the occasion required.  She performed her part\\r\\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was\\r\\nsatisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.  Upon this\\r\\nsignal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.  The\\r\\ntwo girls had been whispering to each other during the whole\\r\\nvisit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr.\\r\\nBingley with having promised on his first coming into the\\r\\ncountry to give a ball at Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\\r\\ncomplexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with\\r\\nher mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an\\r\\nearly age.  She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural\\r\\nself-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom\\r\\nher uncle\\'s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended\\r\\nher, had increased into assurance.  She was very equal,\\r\\ntherefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\\r\\nabruptly reminded him that it would be the most shameful thing\\r\\nin the world if he did not keep it.  His answer to this sudden\\r\\nattack was delightful to her mother\\'s ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and\\r\\nwhen your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the\\r\\nvery day of the ball.  But you would not wish to be dancing\\r\\nwhen she is ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia declared herself satisfied.  \"Oh! yes-- it would be much\\r\\nbetter to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely\\r\\nCaptain Carter would be at Meryton again.  And when you have\\r\\ngiven YOUR ball,\" she added, \"I shall insist on their giving one\\r\\nalso.  I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he\\r\\ndoes not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughter then departed, and Elizabeth\\r\\nreturned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\'\\r\\nbehaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the\\r\\nlatter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in\\r\\ntheir censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingley\\'s witticisms on\\r\\nFINE EYES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 10\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done.  Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the\\r\\ninvalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the\\r\\nevening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.  The\\r\\nloo-table, however, did not appear.  Mr. Darcy was writing, and\\r\\nMiss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his\\r\\nletter and repeatedly calling his attention by messages to his\\r\\nsister.  Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst was observing their game.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently\\r\\namused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his\\r\\ncompanion.  The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on\\r\\nhis handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length\\r\\nof his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises\\r\\nwere received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in\\r\\nunion with her opinion of each.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken.  I write rather slowly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the\\r\\ncourse of a year!  Letters of business, too!  How odious I should\\r\\nthink them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen.  Let me mend it for you.  I\\r\\nmend pens remarkably well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you-- but I always mend my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on\\r\\nthe harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with\\r\\nher beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely\\r\\nsuperior to Miss Grantley\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?\\r\\nAt present I have not room to do them justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  It is of no consequence.  I shall see her in January.  But do\\r\\nyou always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not\\r\\nfor me to determine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter\\r\\nwith ease, cannot write ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried\\r\\nher brother, \"because he does not write with ease.  He studies\\r\\ntoo much for words of four syllables.  Do not you, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless\\r\\nway imaginable.  He leaves out half his words, and blots the\\r\\nrest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--\\r\\nby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to\\r\\nmy correspondents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm\\r\\nreproof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\\r\\nhumility.  It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes\\r\\nan indirect boast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of\\r\\nmodesty?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\r\\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a\\r\\nrapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not\\r\\nestimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The power of\\r\\ndoing anything with quickness is always prized much by the\\r\\npossessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of\\r\\nthe performance.  When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning, that\\r\\nif you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be\\r\\ngone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of\\r\\ncompliment to yourself-- and yet what is there so very laudable\\r\\nin a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\r\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone\\r\\nelse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all\\r\\nthe foolish things that were said in the morning.  And, yet, upon\\r\\nmy honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I\\r\\nbelieve it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume\\r\\nthe character of needless precipitance merely to show off before\\r\\nthe ladies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\r\\nyou would be gone with such celerity.  Your conduct would be\\r\\nquite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if,\\r\\nas you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,  \\'Bingley,\\r\\nyou had better stay till next week,\\' you would probably do it,\\r\\nyou would probably not go-- and at another word, might stay a\\r\\nmonth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr.\\r\\nBingley did not do justice to his own disposition.  You have\\r\\nshown him off now much more than he did himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting\\r\\nwhat my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my\\r\\ntemper.  But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that\\r\\ngentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think\\r\\nbetter of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat\\r\\ndenial, and ride off as fast as I could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original\\r\\nintentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must\\r\\nspeak for himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to\\r\\ncall mine, but which I have never acknowledged.  Allowing the\\r\\ncase, however, to stand according to your representation, you\\r\\nmust remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to\\r\\ndesire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has\\r\\nmerely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in\\r\\nfavour of its propriety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield readily-- easily-- to the PERSUASION of a friend is\\r\\nno merit with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the\\r\\nunderstanding of either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the\\r\\ninfluence of friendship and affection.  A regard for the requester\\r\\nwould often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting\\r\\nfor arguments to reason one into it.  I am not particularly\\r\\nspeaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance\\r\\noccurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\r\\nthereupon.  But in general and ordinary cases between friend and\\r\\nfriend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a\\r\\nresolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that\\r\\nperson for complying with the desire, without waiting to be\\r\\nargued into it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\r\\narrange with rather more precision the degree of importance\\r\\nwhich is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of\\r\\nintimacy subsisting between the parties?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\\r\\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have\\r\\nmore weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be\\r\\naware of.  I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall\\r\\nfellow, in comparison with myself, that I should not pay him half\\r\\nso much deference.  I declare I do not know a more awful object\\r\\nthan Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at\\r\\nhis own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has\\r\\nnothing to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that\\r\\nhe was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.  Miss\\r\\nBingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an\\r\\nexpostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend.  \"You dislike an\\r\\nargument, and want to silence this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps I do.  Arguments are too much like disputes.  If you\\r\\nand Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall\\r\\nbe very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and\\r\\nElizabeth for an indulgence of some music.  Miss Bingley moved\\r\\nwith some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request\\r\\nthat Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely\\r\\nand more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\\r\\nemployed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned\\r\\nover some music-books that lay on the instrument, how\\r\\nfrequently Mr. Darcy\\'s eyes were fixed on her.  She hardly knew\\r\\nhow to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so\\r\\ngreat a man; and yet that he should look at her because he\\r\\ndisliked her, was still more strange.  She could only imagine,\\r\\nhowever, at last that she drew his notice because there was\\r\\nsomething more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas\\r\\nof right, than in any other person present.  The supposition did\\r\\nnot pain her.  She liked him too little to care for his approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm\\r\\nby a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing\\r\\nnear Elizabeth, said to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such\\r\\nan opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled, but made no answer.  He repeated the question, with\\r\\nsome surprise at her silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not immediately\\r\\ndetermine what to say in reply.  You wanted me, I know, to say\\r\\n\\'Yes,\\' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;\\r\\nbut I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and\\r\\ncheating a person of their meditated contempt.  I have,\\r\\ntherefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to\\r\\ndance a reel at all-- and now despise me if you dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at\\r\\nhis gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness\\r\\nin her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;\\r\\nand Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he\\r\\nwas by her.  He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority\\r\\nof her connections, he should be in some danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her\\r\\ngreat anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received\\r\\nsome assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by\\r\\ntalking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in\\r\\nsuch an alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the\\r\\nshrubbery the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few\\r\\nhints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage\\r\\nof holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the\\r\\nyounger girls of running after officers.  And, if I may mention so\\r\\ndelicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,\\r\\nbordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady\\r\\npossesses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes.  Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips get\\r\\nplaced in the gallery at Pemberley.  Put them next to your\\r\\ngreat-uncle the judge.  They are in the same profession, you\\r\\nknow, only in different lines.  As for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you\\r\\nmust not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those\\r\\nbeautiful eyes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\\r\\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might\\r\\nbe copied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Elizabeth herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley,\\r\\nin some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You used us abominably ill, \"answered Mrs. Hurst, \"running\\r\\naway without telling us that you were coming out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth\\r\\nto walk by herself.  The path just admitted three.  Mr. Darcy felt\\r\\ntheir rudeness, and immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party.  We had better go\\r\\ninto the avenue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with\\r\\nthem, laughingly answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; stay where you are.  You are charmingly grouped, and\\r\\nappear to uncommon advantage.  The picturesque would be\\r\\nspoilt by admitting a fourth.  Good-bye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the\\r\\nhope of being at home again in a day or two.  Jane was already\\r\\nso much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of\\r\\nhours that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 11\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\r\\nsister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into\\r\\nthe drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends\\r\\nwith many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen\\r\\nthem so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed\\r\\nbefore the gentlemen appeared.  Their powers of conversation\\r\\nwere considerable.  They could describe an entertainment with\\r\\naccuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\\r\\nacquaintance with spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first\\r\\nobject; Miss Bingley\\'s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,\\r\\nand she had something to say to him before he had advanced\\r\\nmany steps.  He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite\\r\\ncongratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said\\r\\nhe was \"very glad\"; but diffuseness and warmth remained for\\r\\nBingley\\'s salutation.  He was full of joy and attention.  The first\\r\\nhalf-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer\\r\\nfrom the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the\\r\\nother side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the\\r\\ndoor.  He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\r\\nelse.  Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with\\r\\ngreat delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\r\\ncard-table-- but in vain.  She had obtained private intelligence\\r\\nthat Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found\\r\\neven his open petition rejected.  She assured him that no one\\r\\nintended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the\\r\\nsubject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to\\r\\ndo, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\\r\\nDarcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\\r\\nrings, joined now and then in her brother\\'s conversation with\\r\\nMiss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s progress through HIS book, as in reading her own;\\r\\nand she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking\\r\\nat his page.  She could not win him, however, to any\\r\\nconversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.  At\\r\\nlength, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her\\r\\nown book, which she had only chosen because it was the second\\r\\nvolume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it\\r\\nis to spend an evening in this way!  I declare after all there is no\\r\\nenjoyment like reading!  How much sooner one tires of anything\\r\\nthan of a book!  When I have a house of my own, I shall be\\r\\nmiserable if I have not an excellent library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one made any reply.  She then yawned again, threw aside her\\r\\nbook, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some\\r\\namusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss\\r\\nBennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance\\r\\nat Netherfield?  I would advise you, before you determine on it,\\r\\nto consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if\\r\\nthere are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a\\r\\npunishment than a pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he\\r\\nchooses, before it begins-- but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\r\\nthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I\\r\\nshall send round my cards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\\r\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something\\r\\ninsufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.  It\\r\\nwould surely be much more rational if conversation instead of\\r\\ndancing were made the order of the day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would\\r\\nnot be near so much like a ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up\\r\\nand walked about the room.  Her figure was elegant, and she\\r\\nwalked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still\\r\\ninflexibly studious.  In the desperation of her feelings, she\\r\\nresolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example,\\r\\nand take a turn about the room.  I assure you it is very refreshing\\r\\nafter sitting so long in one attitude.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.  Miss\\r\\nBingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.\\r\\nDarcy looked up.  He was as much awake to the novelty of\\r\\nattention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and\\r\\nunconsciously closed his book.  He was directly invited to join\\r\\ntheir party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine\\r\\nbut two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the\\r\\nroom together, with either of which motives his joining them\\r\\nwould interfere.  \"What could he mean?  She was dying to know\\r\\nwhat could be his meaning?\"-- and asked Elizabeth whether she\\r\\ncould at all understand him?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to\\r\\nbe severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be\\r\\nto ask nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.\\r\\nDarcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an\\r\\nexplanation of his two motives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he,\\r\\nas soon as she allowed him to speak.  \"You either choose this\\r\\nmethod of passing the evening because you are in each other\\'s\\r\\nconfidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are\\r\\nconscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in\\r\\nwalking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if\\r\\nthe second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley.  \"I never heard anything so\\r\\nabominable.  How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\"We can all plague and punish one another.  Tease him-- laugh\\r\\nat him.  Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be\\r\\ndone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But upon my honour, I do NOT.  I do assure you that my\\r\\nintimacy has not yet taught me THAT.  Tease calmness of\\r\\nmanner and presence of mind!  No, no-- feel he may defy us\\r\\nthere.  And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you\\r\\nplease, by attempting to laugh without a subject.  Mr. Darcy may\\r\\nhug himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"That is an\\r\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue,\\r\\nfor it would be a great loss to ME to have many such\\r\\nacquaintances.  I dearly love a laugh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than can be.\\r\\nThe wisest and the best of men-- nay, the wisest and best of their\\r\\nactions-- may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first\\r\\nobject in life is a joke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth-- \"there are such people, but I\\r\\nhope I am not one of THEM.  I hope I never ridicule what is\\r\\nwise and good.  Follies and nonsense, whims and\\r\\ninconsistencies, DO divert me, I own, and I laugh at them\\r\\nwhenever I can.  But these, I suppose, are precisely what you\\r\\nare without.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.  But it has been the\\r\\nstudy of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a\\r\\nstrong understanding to ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.  But pride-- where there is a\\r\\nreal superiority of mind, pride will be always under good\\r\\nregulation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"and pray what is the result?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.\\r\\nHe owns it himself without disguise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension.  I have\\r\\nfaults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.  My\\r\\ntemper I dare not vouch for.  It is, I believe, too little yielding--\\r\\ncertainly too little for the convenience of the world.  I cannot\\r\\nforget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their\\r\\noffenses against myself.  My feelings are not puffed about with\\r\\nevery attempt to move them.  My temper would perhaps be\\r\\ncalled resentful.  My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable\\r\\nresentment IS a shade in a character.  But you have chosen your\\r\\nfault well.  I really cannot LAUGH at it.  You are safe from me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some\\r\\nparticular evil-- a natural defect, which not even the best\\r\\neducation can overcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And YOUR defect is to hate everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yours, \"he replied with a smile, \"is willfully to\\r\\nmisunderstand them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\r\\nconversation in which she had no share.  \"Louisa, you will not\\r\\nmind my waking Mr. Hurst?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\r\\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments\\' recollection, was not\\r\\nsorry for it.  He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too\\r\\nmuch attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 12\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth\\r\\nwrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage\\r\\nmight be sent for them in the course of the day.  But Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at\\r\\nNetherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly\\r\\nfinish Jane\\'s week, could not bring herself to receive them with\\r\\npleasure before.  Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\r\\nleast not to Elizabeth\\'s wishes, for she was impatient to get\\r\\nhome.  Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly\\r\\nhave the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was\\r\\nadded, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay\\r\\nlonger, she could spare them very well.  Against staying longer,\\r\\nhowever, Elizabeth was positively resolved-- nor did she much\\r\\nexpect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being\\r\\nconsidered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged\\r\\nJane to borrow Mr. Bingley\\'s carriage immediately, and at\\r\\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving\\r\\nNetherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and\\r\\nenough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the\\r\\nfollowing day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going\\r\\nwas deferred.  Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had\\r\\nproposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister\\r\\nmuch exceeded her affection for the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were\\r\\nto go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that\\r\\nit would not be safe for her-- that she was not enough recovered;\\r\\nbut Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence-- Elizabeth had been\\r\\nat Netherfield long enough.  She attracted him more than he\\r\\nliked-- and Miss Bingley was uncivil to HER, and more teasing\\r\\nthan usual to himself.  He wisely resolved to be particularly\\r\\ncareful that no sign of admiration should NOW escape him,\\r\\nnothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his\\r\\nfelicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his\\r\\nbehaviour during the last day must have material weight in\\r\\nconfirming or crushing it.  Steady to his purpose, he scarcely\\r\\nspoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and\\r\\nthough they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour,\\r\\nhe adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not\\r\\neven look at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable\\r\\nto almost all, took place.  Miss Bingley\\'s civility to Elizabeth\\r\\nincreased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane;\\r\\nand when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it\\r\\nwould always give her to see her either at Longbourn or\\r\\nNetherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook\\r\\nhands with the former.  Elizabeth took leave of the whole party\\r\\nin the liveliest of spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very\\r\\nwrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have\\r\\ncaught cold again.  But their father, though very laconic in his\\r\\nexpressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt\\r\\ntheir importance in the family circle.  The evening conversation,\\r\\nwhen they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation,\\r\\nand almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass\\r\\nand human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some\\r\\nnew observations of threadbare morality to listen to.  Catherine\\r\\nand Lydia had information for them of a different sort.  Much\\r\\nhad been done and much had been said in the regiment since the\\r\\npreceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately\\r\\nwith their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually\\r\\nbeen hinted that colonel Foster was going to be married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\r\\nbreakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a good\\r\\ndinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our\\r\\nfamily party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who do you mean, my dear?  I know of nobody that is coming,\\r\\nI am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in-- And\\r\\nI hope MY dinners are good enough for her.  I do not believe\\r\\nshe often sees such at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled.  \"A gentleman and a stranger!  It is\\r\\nMr. Bingley, I am sure!  Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad\\r\\nto see Mr. Bingley.  But--good Lord! how unlucky!  There is not\\r\\na bit of fish to be got to-day.  Lydia, my love, ring the bell-- I\\r\\nmust speak to Hill this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is NOT Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person whom\\r\\nI never saw in the whole course of my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of\\r\\nbeing eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\r\\nexplained:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight\\r\\nago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and\\r\\nrequiring early attention.  It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\\r\\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\\r\\npleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that\\r\\nmentioned.  Pray do not talk of that odious man.  I do think it is\\r\\nthe hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed\\r\\naway from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I\\r\\nshould have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.\\r\\nThey had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on\\r\\nwhich Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she\\r\\ncontinued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling and estate\\r\\naway from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom\\r\\nnobody cared anything about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and\\r\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting\\r\\nLongbourn.  But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps\\r\\nbe a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent\\r\\nof him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.  I hate such\\r\\nfalse friends.  Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as\\r\\nhis father did before him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on\\r\\nthat head, as you will hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                      \"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\\r\\n                                                   \"15th October.\\r\\n\"Dear Sir,--\\r\\n\"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late\\r\\nhonoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I\\r\\nhave had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to\\r\\nheal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own\\r\\ndoubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for\\r\\nme to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always\\r\\npleased him to be at variance,--  \\'There, Mrs. Bennet.\\'-- My\\r\\nmind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\\r\\nreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be\\r\\ndistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose\\r\\nbounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory\\r\\nof this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean\\r\\nmyself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever\\r\\nready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted\\r\\nby the Church of England.  As a clergyman,  moreover, I feel it\\r\\nmy duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all\\r\\nfamilies within in the reach of my influence; and on these\\r\\ngrounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly\\r\\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\\r\\nentail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your\\r\\nside, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.  I\\r\\ncannot otherwise than be concerned at being the means of\\r\\ninjuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for\\r\\nit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every\\r\\npossible amends-- but of this hereafter.  If you should have no\\r\\nobjection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the\\r\\nsatisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,\\r\\nNovember 18th, by four o\\'clock, and shall probably trespass on\\r\\nyour hospitality till the Saturday se\\'ennight following, which I\\r\\ncan do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from\\r\\nobjecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that\\r\\nsome other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.-- I\\r\\nremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and\\r\\ndaughters, your well-wisher and friend,\\r\\n                                   \"WILLIAM COLLINS\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At four o\\'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making\\r\\ngentleman,\" said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.  \"He\\r\\nseems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon\\r\\nmy word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,\\r\\nespecially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him\\r\\ncome to us again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,\\r\\nand if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the\\r\\nperson to discourage him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he can\\r\\nmean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is\\r\\ncertainly to his credit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for\\r\\nLady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,\\r\\nand burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she.  \"I cannot make him\\r\\nout.  There is something very pompous in his style.  And what\\r\\ncan he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?  We\\r\\ncannot suppose he would help it if he could.  Could he be a\\r\\nsensible man, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, I think not.  I have great hopes of finding him\\r\\nquite the reverse.  Thee is a mixture of servility and\\r\\nself-importance in his letter, which promises well.  I am\\r\\nimpatient to see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"the letter does not seem\\r\\ndefective.  The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly\\r\\nnew, yet I think it is well expressed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in\\r\\nany degree interesting.  It was next to impossible that their\\r\\ncousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some\\r\\nweeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a\\r\\nman in any other colour.  As for their mother, Mr. Collins\\'s letter\\r\\nhad done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see\\r\\nhim with a degree of composure which astonished her husband\\r\\nand daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with\\r\\ngreat politeness by the whole family.  Mr. Bennet indeed said\\r\\nlittle; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins\\r\\nseemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be\\r\\nsilent himself.  He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of\\r\\nfive-and-twenty.  His air was grave and stately, and his manners\\r\\nwere very formal. He had not been long seated before he\\r\\ncomplimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\r\\ndaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in\\r\\nthis instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that\\r\\nhe did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in\\r\\nmarriage.  This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of\\r\\nhis hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no\\r\\ncompliments, answered most readily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it\\r\\nmay prove so, for else they will be destitute enough.  Things are\\r\\nsettled so oddly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed.  It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\r\\nmust confess.  Not that I mean to find fault with YOU, for such\\r\\nthings I know are all chance in this world.  There is no knowing\\r\\nhow estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,\\r\\nand could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of\\r\\nappearing forward and precipitate.  But I can assure the young\\r\\nladies that I come prepared to admire them.  At present I will\\r\\nnot say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled\\r\\non each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collin\\'s\\r\\nadmiration.  The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were\\r\\nexamined and praised; and his commendation of everything\\r\\nwould have touched Mrs. Bennet\\'s heart, but for the mortifying\\r\\nsupposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.  The\\r\\ndinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to\\r\\nknow to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking\\r\\nwas owing.  But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\\r\\nassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to\\r\\nkeep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in\\r\\nthe kitchen.  He begged pardon for having displeased her.  In a\\r\\nsoftened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he\\r\\ncontinued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 14\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the\\r\\nservants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some\\r\\nconversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in\\r\\nwhich he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed\\r\\nvery fortunate in his patroness.  Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\'s\\r\\nattention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort,\\r\\nappeared very remarkable.  Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\r\\nbetter.  Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.  The subject\\r\\nelevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a\\r\\nmost important aspect he protested that \"he had never in his life\\r\\nwitnessed such behaviour in a person of rank-- such affability\\r\\nand condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  She had been graciously pleased to approve of both\\r\\nof the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\r\\npreaching before her.  She had also asked him twice to dine at\\r\\nRosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make\\r\\nup her pool of quadrille in the evening.  Lady Catherine was\\r\\nreckoned proud by many people he knew, but HE had never\\r\\nseen anything but affability in her.  She had always spoken to\\r\\nhim as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the\\r\\nsmallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\r\\nneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a\\r\\nweek or two, to visit his relations.  She had even condescended\\r\\nto advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose\\r\\nwith discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble\\r\\nparsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations\\r\\nhe had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some\\r\\nherself-- some shelves in the closet upstairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.  It is a pity that\\r\\ngreat ladies in general are not more like her.  Does she live near\\r\\nyou, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only\\r\\nby a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir?  Has she any family?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\r\\nextensive property.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off\\r\\nthan many girls.  And what sort of young lady is she?  Is she\\r\\nhandsome?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine\\r\\nherself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far\\r\\nsuperior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in\\r\\nher features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.\\r\\nShe is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented\\r\\nher from making that progress in many accomplishments which\\r\\nshe could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the\\r\\nlady who superintended her education, and who still resides with\\r\\nthem.  But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to\\r\\ndrive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among\\r\\nthe ladies at court.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in\\r\\ntown; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has\\r\\ndeprived the British court of its brightest ornaments.  Her\\r\\nladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that\\r\\nI am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate\\r\\ncompliments which are always acceptable to ladies.  I have more\\r\\nthan once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming\\r\\ndaughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\\r\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be\\r\\nadorned by her.  These are the kind of little things which please\\r\\nher ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself\\r\\npeculiarly bound to pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for\\r\\nyou that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.  May I\\r\\nask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse\\r\\nof the moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though\\r\\nI sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such\\r\\nlittle elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary\\r\\noccasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s expectations were fully answered.  His cousin was\\r\\nas absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the\\r\\nkeenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most\\r\\nresolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional\\r\\nglance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr.\\r\\nBennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again,\\r\\nand, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the\\r\\nladies.  Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced;\\r\\nbut, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a\\r\\ncirculating library), he started back, and begging pardon,\\r\\nprotested that he never read novels.  Kitty stared at him, and\\r\\nLydia exclaimed.  Other books were produced, and after some\\r\\ndeliberation he chose Fordyce\\'s Sermons.  Lydia gaped as he\\r\\nopened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous\\r\\nsolemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning\\r\\naway Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.  My\\r\\naunt told me so herself on Saturday.  I shall walk to Meryton\\r\\nto-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny\\r\\ncomes back from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but\\r\\nMr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by\\r\\nbooks of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.\\r\\nIt amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so\\r\\nadvantageous to them as instruction.  But I will no longer\\r\\nimportune my young cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist\\r\\nat backgammon.  Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing\\r\\nthat he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling\\r\\namusements.  Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most\\r\\ncivilly for Lydia\\'s interruption, and promised that it should not\\r\\noccur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after\\r\\nassuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and\\r\\nshould never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself\\r\\nat another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for\\r\\nbackgammon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 15\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature\\r\\nhad been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest\\r\\npart of his life having been spent under the guidance of an\\r\\nilliterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of\\r\\nthe universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without\\r\\nforming at it any useful acquaintance.  The subjection in which\\r\\nhis father had brought him up had given him originally great\\r\\nhumility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by\\r\\nthe self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the\\r\\nconsequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.  A\\r\\nfortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\r\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect\\r\\nwhich he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his\\r\\npatroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his\\r\\nauthority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him\\r\\naltogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness,\\r\\nself-importance and humility.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he\\r\\nintended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the\\r\\nLongbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose\\r\\none of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable\\r\\nas they were represented by common report.  This was his plan\\r\\noff amends-- of atonement-- for inheriting their father\\'s estate;\\r\\nand he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\r\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his\\r\\nown part.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them.  Miss Bennet\\'s lovely face\\r\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of\\r\\nwhat was due to seniority; and for the first evening SHE was his\\r\\nsettled choice.  The next morning, however, made an alteration;\\r\\nfor in a quarter of an hour\\'s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before\\r\\nbreakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house,\\r\\nand leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress\\r\\nmight be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid\\r\\nvery complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution\\r\\nagainst the very Jane he had fixed on.  \"As to her YOUNGER\\r\\ndaughters, she could not take upon her to say-- she could not\\r\\npositively answer-- but she did not KNOW of any prepossession;\\r\\nher ELDEST daughter, she must just mention-- she felt it\\r\\nincumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth-- and it\\r\\nwas soon done-- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.\\r\\nElizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded\\r\\nher of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might\\r\\nsoon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could\\r\\nnot bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good\\r\\ngraces.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten;\\r\\nevery sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most\\r\\nanxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for\\r\\nthither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he\\r\\nwould continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios\\r\\nin the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little\\r\\ncessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.  Such doings\\r\\ndiscomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.  In his library he had been\\r\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as\\r\\nhe told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other\\r\\nroom of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his\\r\\ncivility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to\\r\\njoin his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact\\r\\nmuch better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely\\r\\npleased to close his large book, and go.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\r\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.  The\\r\\nattention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by\\r\\nhim.  Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in\\r\\nquest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet\\r\\nindeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,\\r\\nwhom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike\\r\\nappearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the\\r\\nway.  The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose\\r\\nreturn from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as\\r\\nthey passed.  All were struck with the stranger\\'s air, all\\r\\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\\r\\npossible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense\\r\\nof wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had\\r\\njust gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back,\\r\\nhad reached the same spot.  Mr. Denny addressed them directly,\\r\\nand entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nwho had returned with him the day before from town, and he\\r\\nwas happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.\\r\\nThis was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only\\r\\nregimentals to make him completely charming.  His appearance\\r\\nwas greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a\\r\\nfine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.  The\\r\\nintroduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of\\r\\nconversation-- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\\r\\nunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking\\r\\ntogether very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their\\r\\nnotice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.\\r\\nOn distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen\\r\\ncame directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.\\r\\nBingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\\r\\nprincipal object.  He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn\\r\\non purpose to inquire after her.  Mr. Darcy corroborated it with\\r\\na bow, an was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on\\r\\nElizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\\r\\nstranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of\\r\\nboth as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the\\r\\neffect of the meeting.  Both changed colour, one looked white,\\r\\nthe other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his\\r\\nhat-- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What\\r\\ncould be the meaning of it?  It was impossible to imagine; it was\\r\\nimpossible not to long to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have\\r\\nnoticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to\\r\\nthe door of Mr. Phillip\\'s house, and then made their bows, in\\r\\nspite of Miss Lydia\\'s pressing entreaties that they should come\\r\\nin, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips\\'s throwing up the parlour\\r\\nwindow and loudly seconding the invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two\\r\\neldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and\\r\\nshe was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return\\r\\nhome, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she\\r\\nshould have known nothing about, if she had not happened to\\r\\nsee Mr. Jones\\'s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that\\r\\nthey were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because\\r\\nthe Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was\\r\\nclaimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\\'s introduction of him.  She\\r\\nreceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned\\r\\nwith as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any\\r\\nprevious acquaintance with her, which he could not help\\r\\nflattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship\\r\\nto the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.  Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but\\r\\nher contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by\\r\\nexclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however,\\r\\nshe could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.\\r\\nDenny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\r\\nlieutenant\\'s commission in the ----shire.  She had been watching\\r\\nhim the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,\\r\\nand had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly\\r\\nhave continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed\\r\\nwindows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison\\r\\nwith the stranger, were become \"stupid, disagreeable fellows.\"\\r\\nSome of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and\\r\\ntheir aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nand give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\r\\nwould come in the evening.  This was agreed to, and Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy\\r\\ngame of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.\\r\\nThe prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted\\r\\nin mutual good spirits.  Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in\\r\\nquitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that\\r\\nthey were perfectly needless.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had\\r\\nseen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would\\r\\nhave defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the\\r\\nwrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by\\r\\nadmiring Mrs. Phillips\\'s manners and politeness.  He protested\\r\\nthat, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen\\r\\na more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with\\r\\nthe utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her\\r\\ninvitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her\\r\\nbefore.  Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his\\r\\nconnection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\\r\\nattention in the whole course of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 16\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs no objection was made to the young people\\'s engagement\\r\\nwith their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\\'s scruples of leaving Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most\\r\\nsteadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at\\r\\na suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of\\r\\nhearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nhad accepted their uncle\\'s invitation, and was then in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their\\r\\nseats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,\\r\\nand he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the\\r\\napartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed\\r\\nhimself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a\\r\\ncomparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but\\r\\nwhen Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and\\r\\nwho was its proprietor-- when she had listened to the description\\r\\nof only one of Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-rooms, and found that\\r\\nthe chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt\\r\\nall the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented\\r\\na comparison with the housekeeper\\'s room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her\\r\\nmansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble\\r\\nabode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily\\r\\nemployed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his\\r\\nconsequence increased with what she heard, and who was\\r\\nresolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she\\r\\ncould.  To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and\\r\\nwho had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and\\r\\nexamine their own indifferent imitations of china on the\\r\\nmantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.  It was\\r\\nover at last, however.  The gentlemen did approach, and when\\r\\nMr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had\\r\\nneither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with\\r\\nthe smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of\\r\\nthe ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set,\\r\\nand the best of them were of the present party; but Mr.\\r\\nWickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air,\\r\\nand walk, as THEY were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy\\r\\nuncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every\\r\\nfemale eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by\\r\\nwhom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in\\r\\nwhich he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only\\r\\non its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest,\\r\\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by\\r\\nthe skill of the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and\\r\\nthe officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to\\r\\nthe young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at\\r\\nintervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her\\r\\nwatchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\r\\nWhen the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of\\r\\nobliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be\\r\\nglad to improve myself, for in my situation in life--\" Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nwas very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his\\r\\nreason.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\r\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.  At first\\r\\nthere seemed danger of Lydia\\'s engrossing him entirely, for she\\r\\nwas a most determined talked; but being likewise extremely fond\\r\\nof lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the\\r\\ngame, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to\\r\\nhave attention for anyone in particular.  Allowing for the\\r\\ncommon demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at\\r\\nleisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\\r\\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\\r\\ntold-- the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.  She dared\\r\\nnot even mention that gentleman.  Her curiosity, however, was\\r\\nunexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.\\r\\nHe inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after\\r\\nreceiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr.\\r\\nDarcy had been staying there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the\\r\\nsubject drop, added, \"he is a man of very large property in\\r\\nDerbyshire, I understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one.  A\\r\\nclear ten thousand per annum.  You could not have met with a\\r\\nperson more capable of giving you certain information on that\\r\\nhead than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a\\r\\nparticular manner from my infancy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,\\r\\nafter seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our\\r\\nmeeting yesterday.  Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly.  \"I\\r\\nhave spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him\\r\\nvery disagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no right to give MY opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his\\r\\nbeing agreeable or otherwise.  I am not qualified to form one.  I\\r\\nhave known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.  It is\\r\\nimpossible for ME to be impartial.  But I believe your opinion of\\r\\nhim would in general astonish-- and perhaps you would not\\r\\nexpress it quite so strongly anywhere else.  Here you are in your\\r\\nown family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I say no more HERE than I might say in any\\r\\nhouse in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.  He is not at all\\r\\nliked in Hertfordshire.  Everybody is disgusted with his pride.\\r\\nYou will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\\r\\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated\\r\\nbeyond their deserts; but with HIM I believe it does not often\\r\\nhappen.  The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence,\\r\\nor frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him\\r\\nonly as he chooses to be seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI should take him, even on MY slight acquaintance, to be an\\r\\n ill-tempered man.\"  Wickham shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\\r\\n\"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not at all know; but I HEARD nothing of his going away\\r\\nwhen I was at Netherfield.  I hope your plans in favour of the\\r\\n----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no-- it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.  If\\r\\nHE wishes to avoid seeing ME, he must go.  We are not on\\r\\nfriendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I\\r\\nhave no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim\\r\\nbefore all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\\r\\npainful regrets at his being what he is.  His father, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthe late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,\\r\\nand the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company\\r\\nwith this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\r\\nthousand tender recollections.  His behaviour to myself has been\\r\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\r\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and\\r\\ndisgracing  the memory of his father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened\\r\\nwith all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton,\\r\\nthe neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all\\r\\nthat he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but\\r\\nvery intelligible gallantry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he\\r\\nadded, \"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.  I\\r\\nknew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend\\r\\nDenny tempted me further by his account of their present\\r\\nquarters, and the very great attentions and excellent\\r\\nacquaintances Meryton had procured them.  Society, I own, is\\r\\nnecessary to me.  I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits\\r\\nwill not bear solitude.  I MUST have employment and society.\\r\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances\\r\\nhave now made it eligible.  The church OUGHT to have been\\r\\nmy profession-- I was brought up for the church, and I should at\\r\\nthis time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it\\r\\npleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation\\r\\nof the best living in his gift.  He was my godfather, and\\r\\nexcessively attached to me.  I cannot do justice to his kindness.\\r\\nHe meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it;\\r\\nbut when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could THAT be?\\r\\nHow could his will be disregarded?  Why did you not seek legal\\r\\nredress?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest\\r\\nas to give me no hope from law.  A man of honour could not\\r\\nhave doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it-- or\\r\\nto treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert\\r\\nthat I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence--\\r\\nin short anything or nothing.  Certain it is, that the living became\\r\\nvacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and\\r\\nthat it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I\\r\\ncannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve\\r\\nto lose it.  I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have\\r\\nspoken my opinion OF him, and TO him, too freely.  I can recall\\r\\nnothing worse.  But the fact is, that we are very different sort of\\r\\nmen, and that he hates me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is quite shocking!  He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some time or other he WILL be-- but it shall not be by ME.\\r\\nTill I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose HIM.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\\r\\nhandsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?\\r\\nWhat can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me-- a dislike which I cannot\\r\\nbut attribute in some measure to jealousy.  Had the late Mr.\\r\\nDarcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better;\\r\\nbut his father\\'s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I\\r\\nbelieve, very early in life.  He had not a temper to bear the sort of\\r\\ncompetition in which we stood-- the sort of preference which\\r\\nwas often given me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this-- though I have\\r\\nnever liked him.  I had not thought so very ill of him.  I had\\r\\nsupposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but\\r\\ndid not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge,\\r\\nsuch injustice, such inhumanity as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few minutes\\' reflection, however, she continued, \"I DO\\r\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\\r\\nimplacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\\r\\ntemper.  His disposition must be dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\ncan hardly be just to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,\\r\\n\"to treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of\\r\\nhis father!\"  She could have added, \"a young man, too, like\\r\\nYOU, whose very countenance may vouch for your being\\r\\namiable\"-- but she contented herself with, \"and one, too, who\\r\\nhad probably been his companion from childhood, connected\\r\\ntogether, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the\\r\\ngreatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the\\r\\nsame house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same\\r\\nparental care.  MY father began life in the profession which your\\r\\nuncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to-- but he\\r\\ngave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and\\r\\ndevoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.  He\\r\\nwas most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate,\\r\\nconfidential friend.  Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be\\r\\nunder the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active\\r\\nsuperintendence, and when, immediately before my father\\'s\\r\\ndeath, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for\\r\\nme, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of\\r\\ngratitude to HIM, as of his affection to myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"How abominable!  I wonder\\r\\nthat the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to\\r\\nyou!  If from no better motive, that he should not have been too\\r\\nproud to be dishonest-- for dishonesty I must call it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It IS wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions\\r\\nmay be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\\r\\nIt has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other\\r\\nfeeling.  But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour\\r\\nto me there were stronger impulses even than pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.  It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his\\r\\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and\\r\\nrelieve the poor.  Family pride, and FILIAL pride-- for he is very\\r\\nproud of what his father was-- have done this.  Not to appear to\\r\\ndisgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or\\r\\nlose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.\\r\\nHe has also BROTHERLY pride, which, with SOME brotherly\\r\\naffection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his\\r\\nsister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most\\r\\nattentive and best of brothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.  \"I wish I could call her amiable.  It gives me\\r\\npain to speak ill of a Darcy.  But she is too much like her\\r\\nbrother-- very, very proud.  As a child, she was affectionate and\\r\\npleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours\\r\\nand hours to her amusement.  But she is nothing to me now.\\r\\nShe is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I\\r\\nunderstand, highly accomplished.  Since her father\\'s death, her\\r\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and\\r\\nsuperintends her education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!  How can Mr.\\r\\nBingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,\\r\\ntruly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?  How can they\\r\\nsuit each other?  Do you know Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.  He cannot\\r\\nknow what Mr. Darcy is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.  He\\r\\ndoes not want abilities.  He can be a conversible companion if he\\r\\nthinks it worth his while.  Among those who are at all his equals\\r\\nin consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the\\r\\nless prosperous.  His pride never deserts him; but with the rich\\r\\nhe is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and\\r\\nperhaps agreeable-- allowing something for fortune and figure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players\\r\\ngathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station\\r\\nbetween his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips.  The usual\\r\\ninquiries as to his success was made by the latter.  It had not\\r\\nbeen very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nbegan to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with\\r\\nmuch earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that\\r\\nhe considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she\\r\\nwould not make herself uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down\\r\\nto a card table, they must take their chances of these things, and\\r\\nhappily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings\\r\\nany object.  There are undoubtedly many who could not say the\\r\\nsame, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed\\r\\nfar beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s attention was caught; and after observing Mr,.\\r\\nCollins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice\\r\\nwhether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the\\r\\nfamily of de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given\\r\\nhim a living.  I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first\\r\\nintroduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her\\r\\nlong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady\\r\\nAnne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the\\r\\npresent Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I did not.  I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nconnections.  I never heard of her existence till the day before\\r\\nyesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,\\r\\nand it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two\\r\\nestates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor\\r\\nMiss Bingley.  Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and\\r\\nuseless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he\\r\\nwere already self-destined for another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine\\r\\nand her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related\\r\\nof her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in\\r\\nspite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited\\r\\nwoman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\nhave not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that\\r\\nI never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and\\r\\ninsolent.  She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible\\r\\nand clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities\\r\\nfrom her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,\\r\\nand the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that\\r\\nevery one connected with him should have an understanding of\\r\\nthe first class.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it,\\r\\nand they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till\\r\\nsupper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their\\r\\nshare of Mr. Wickham\\'s attentions.  There could be no\\r\\nconversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips\\'s supper party, but his\\r\\nmanners recommended him to everybody.  Whatever he said,\\r\\nwas said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwent away with her head full of him.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nbut of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way\\r\\nhome; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\\r\\nas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.\\r\\nLydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost\\r\\nand the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the\\r\\ncivility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the\\r\\nleast regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at\\r\\nsupper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had\\r\\nmore to say than he could well manage before the carriage\\r\\nstopped at Longbourn House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 17\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between\\r\\nMr. Wickham and herself.  Jane listened with astonishment and\\r\\nconcern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be\\r\\nso unworthy of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard; and yet, it was not in her\\r\\nnature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable\\r\\nappearance as Wickham.  The possibility of his having endured\\r\\nsuch unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings;\\r\\nand nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of\\r\\nthem both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the\\r\\naccount of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise\\r\\nexplained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some\\r\\nway or other, of which we can form no idea.  Interested people\\r\\nhave perhaps misrepresented each to the other.  It is, in short,\\r\\nimpossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances\\r\\nwhich may have alienated them, without actual blame on either\\r\\nside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got\\r\\nto say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been\\r\\nconcerned in the business?  Do clear THEM too, or we shall be\\r\\nobliged to think ill of somebody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of\\r\\nmy opinion.  My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a\\r\\ndisgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\\'s\\r\\nfavourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to\\r\\nprovide for.  It is impossible.  No man of common humanity, no\\r\\nman who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.\\r\\nCan his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?\\r\\nOh! no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\'s being imposed on,\\r\\nthan that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as\\r\\nhe gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned\\r\\nwithout ceremony.  If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.\\r\\nBesides, there was truth in his looks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is difficult indeed-- it is distressing.  One does not know what\\r\\nto think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point-- that Mr.\\r\\nBingley, if he HAD been imposed on, would have much to suffer\\r\\nwhen the affair became public.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery,\\r\\nwhere this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very\\r\\npersons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his\\r\\nsisters came to give their personal invitation for the\\r\\nlong-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the\\r\\nfollowing Tuesday.  The two ladies were delighted to see their\\r\\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\\r\\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since\\r\\ntheir separation.  To the rest of the family they paid little\\r\\nattention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not\\r\\nmuch to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.  They were\\r\\nsoon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which\\r\\ntook their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to\\r\\nescape from Mrs. Bennet\\'s civilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to\\r\\nevery female of the family.  Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as\\r\\ngiven in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly\\r\\nflattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,\\r\\ninstead of a ceremonious card.  Jane pictured to herself a happy\\r\\nevening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of\\r\\nher brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a\\r\\ngreat deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of\\r\\neverything in Mr. Darcy\\'s look and behavior.  The happiness\\r\\nanticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single\\r\\nevent, or any particular person, for though they each, like\\r\\nElizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nhe was be no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and\\r\\na ball was, at any rate, a ball.  And even Mary could assure her\\r\\nfamily that she had no disinclination for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is\\r\\nenough-- I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening\\r\\nengagements.  Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself\\r\\none of hose who consider intervals of recreation and amusement\\r\\nas desirable for everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she\\r\\ndid not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not\\r\\nhelp asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\\'s\\r\\ninvitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join\\r\\nin the evening\\'s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find\\r\\nthat he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was\\r\\nvery far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a\\r\\nball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to\\r\\nrespectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far\\r\\nfrom objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be\\r\\nhonoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of\\r\\nthe evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss\\r\\nElizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which\\r\\nI trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to\\r\\nany disrespect for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in.  She had fully\\r\\nproposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances;\\r\\nand to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been\\r\\nworse times.  There was no help for it, however.  Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little\\r\\nlonger, and Mr. Collins\\' proposal accepted with as good a grace\\r\\nas she could.  She was not better the pleased with his gallantry\\r\\nfrom the idea it suggested of something more.  It now first\\r\\nstruck her, that SHE was selected from among her sisters as\\r\\nworthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of\\r\\nassisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of\\r\\nmore eligible visitors.  The idea soon reached to conviction, as\\r\\nshe observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard\\r\\nhis frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and\\r\\nthough more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of\\r\\nher charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to\\r\\nunderstand that the probability of their marriage was extremely\\r\\nagreeable to HER.  Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take\\r\\nthe hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\r\\nconsequence of any reply.  Mr. Collins might never make the\\r\\noffer, and, till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk\\r\\nof, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable\\r\\nstate at this time, for form the day of the invitation, to the day of\\r\\nthe ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their\\r\\nwalking to Meryton once.  No aunt, no officers, no news could\\r\\nbe sought after-- the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by\\r\\nproxy.  Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her\\r\\npatience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of\\r\\nher acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a\\r\\ndance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday,\\r\\nSunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 18\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and\\r\\nlooked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats\\r\\nthere assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred\\r\\nto her.  The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by\\r\\nany of those recollections that might not unreasonably have\\r\\nalarmed her.  She had dressed with more than usual care, and\\r\\nprepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that\\r\\nremained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more\\r\\nthan might be won in the course of the evening.  But in an\\r\\ninstant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely\\r\\nomitted for Mr. Darcy\\'s pleasure in the Bingleys\\' invitation to the\\r\\nofficers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute\\r\\nfact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to\\r\\nwhom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham\\r\\nhad been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and\\r\\nwas not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, \"I do not\\r\\nimagine his business would have called him away just now, if he\\r\\nhad not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was\\r\\ncaught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not\\r\\nless answerable for Wickham\\'s absence than if her first surmise\\r\\nhad been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former\\r\\nwas so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could\\r\\nhardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which\\r\\nhe directly afterwards approached to make.  Attendance,\\r\\nforbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.  She\\r\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\\r\\nturned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not\\r\\nwholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind\\r\\npartiality provoked her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every\\r\\nprospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not\\r\\ndwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was\\r\\nsoon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her\\r\\ncousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.  The first\\r\\ntwo dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were\\r\\ndances of mortification.  Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\r\\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong\\r\\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery\\r\\nwhich disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.  The\\r\\nmoment of her release from him was ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of\\r\\ntalking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.\\r\\nWhen those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas,\\r\\nand was in conversation with her, when she found herself\\r\\nsuddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by\\r\\nsurprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing\\r\\nwhat she did, she accepted him.  He walked away again\\r\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of\\r\\npresence of mind;  Charlotte tried to console her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heaven forbid!  THAT would be the greatest misfortune of all!\\r\\nTo find a man agreeable whom on is determined to hate!  Do not\\r\\nwish me such an evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy\\r\\napproached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help\\r\\ncautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her\\r\\nfancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of\\r\\na man ten times his consequence.  Elizabeth made no answer,\\r\\nand took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she\\r\\nwas arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nand reading in her neighbours\\' looks, their equal amazement in\\r\\nbeholding it.  They stood for some time without speaking a\\r\\nword; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last\\r\\nthrough the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it;\\r\\ntill suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to\\r\\nher partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight\\r\\nobservation on the dance.  He replied, and was again silent.\\r\\nAfter a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\\r\\nwith:-- \"It is YOUR turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\ntalked about the dance, and YOU ought to make some sort of\\r\\nremark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say\\r\\nshould be said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  That reply will do for the present.  Perhaps by and\\r\\nby I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than\\r\\npublic ones.  But NOW we may be silent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes.  One must speak a little, you know.  It would look\\r\\nodd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the\\r\\nadvantage of SOME, conversation ought to be so arranged, as\\r\\nthat they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do\\r\\nyou imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\\r\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds.  We are each of an unsocial,\\r\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\r\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down\\r\\nto posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I\\r\\nam sure,\" said he.  \"How near it may be to MINE, I cannot\\r\\npretend to say.  YOU think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone\\r\\ndown the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not\\r\\nvery often walk to Meryton?  She answered in the affirmative,\\r\\nand, unable to resist the temptation, added, \"When you met us\\r\\nthere the other day, we had just been forming a new\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect was immediate.  A deeper shade of hauteur\\r\\noverspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth,\\r\\nthough blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.\\r\\nAt length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, \"Mr.\\r\\nWickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his\\r\\nMAKING friends-- whether he may be equally capable of\\r\\nRETAINING them, is less certain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to\\r\\nsuffer from all his life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the\\r\\nsubject.  At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to\\r\\nthem, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the\\r\\nroom; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of\\r\\nsuperior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his\\r\\npartner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.  Such\\r\\nvery superior dancing is not often seen.  It is evident that you\\r\\nbelong to the first circles.  Allow me to say, however, that your\\r\\nfair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have\\r\\nthis pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable\\r\\nevent, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall\\r\\ntake place.  What congratulations will then flow in!  I appeal to\\r\\nMr. Darcy:-- but let me not interrupt you, sir.  You will not\\r\\nthank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\\r\\nyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but\\r\\nSir William\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly,\\r\\nand his eyes were directed with a very serious expression\\r\\ntowards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.\\r\\nRecovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,\\r\\nand said, \"Sir William\\'s interruption has made me forget what\\r\\nwe were talking of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all.  Sir William could not\\r\\nhave interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for\\r\\nthemselves.  We have tried two or three subjects already without\\r\\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Books-- oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with\\r\\nthe same feelings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at\\r\\nleast be no want of subject.  We may compare our different\\r\\nopinions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always\\r\\nfull of something else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenes-- does it?\"\\r\\nsaid he, with a look of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for\\r\\nher thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon\\r\\nafterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember\\r\\nhearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,\\r\\nthat you resentment once created was unappeasable.  You are\\r\\nvery cautious, I suppose, as to its BEING CREATED.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their\\r\\nopinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Merely to the illustration of YOUR character,\" said she,\\r\\nendeavouring to shake off her gravity.  \"I am trying to make it\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.  \"I do not get on at all.  I hear such\\r\\ndifferent accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may\\r\\nvary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthat you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,\\r\\nas there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no\\r\\ncredit on either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have\\r\\nanother opportunity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly\\r\\nreplied.  She said no more, and they went down the other dance\\r\\nand parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to\\r\\nan equal degree, for in Darcy\\'s breast there was a tolerable\\r\\npowerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon,\\r\\nand directed all his anger against another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards\\r\\nher, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:-- \"So,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George\\r\\nWickham!  Your sister has been talking to me about him, and\\r\\nasking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man\\r\\nquite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he\\r\\nwas the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy\\'s steward.  Let\\r\\nme recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit\\r\\nconfidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\\'s using him\\r\\nill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been\\r\\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\r\\nMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.  I do not know the\\r\\nparticulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the\\r\\nleast to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham\\r\\nmentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could\\r\\nnot well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\r\\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the\\r\\nway.  His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,\\r\\nindeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.  I pity you,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt; but really,\\r\\nconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the\\r\\nsame,\" said Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him\\r\\nof nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward,\\r\\nand of THAT, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a\\r\\nsneer.  \"Excuse my interference: it was kindly meant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.  \"You are much\\r\\nmistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack\\r\\nas this.  I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the\\r\\nmalice of Mr. Darcy.\"  She then sought her eldest sister, who\\r\\nhas undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.\\r\\nJane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of\\r\\nsuch happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was\\r\\nsatisfied with the occurrences of the evening.  Elizabeth instantly\\r\\nread her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham,\\r\\nresentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\\r\\nbefore the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling\\r\\nthan her sister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.\\r\\nBut perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of\\r\\nany third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\r\\nsatisfactory to tell you.  Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\r\\nhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\r\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good\\r\\nconduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly\\r\\nconvinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention\\r\\nfrom Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by\\r\\nhis account as well as his sister\\'s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a\\r\\nrespectable young man.  I am afraid he has been very imprudent,\\r\\nand has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\nam satisfied.  But what does he say of the living?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\\r\\nheard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that\\r\\nit was left to him CONDITIONALLY only.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth\\r\\nwarmly; \"but you must excuse my not being convinced by\\r\\nassurances only.  Mr. Bingley\\'s defense of his friend was a very\\r\\nable one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several\\r\\nparts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend\\r\\nhimself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did\\r\\nbefore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,\\r\\nand on which there could be no difference of sentiment.\\r\\nElizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest\\r\\nhopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard, and said\\r\\nall in her power to heighten her confidence in it.  On their being\\r\\njoined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss\\r\\nLucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner\\r\\nshe had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\r\\nand told her with great exultation that he had just been so\\r\\nfortunate as to make a most important discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is\\r\\nnow in the room a near relation of my patroness.  I happened to\\r\\noverhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady\\r\\nwho does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss\\r\\nde Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.  How\\r\\nwonderfully these sort of things occur!  Who would have\\r\\nthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh in his assembly!  I am most thankful that\\r\\nthe discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him,\\r\\nwhich I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not\\r\\nhaving done it before.  My total ignorance of the connection\\r\\nmust plead my apology.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I am.  I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it\\r\\nearlier.  I believe him to be Lady Catherine\\'s NEPHEW.  It will\\r\\nbe in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well\\r\\nyesterday se\\'nnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme,\\r\\nassuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him\\r\\nwithout introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a\\r\\ncompliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary\\r\\nthere should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it\\r\\nmust belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin\\r\\nthe acquaintance.  Mr. Collins listened to her with the\\r\\ndetermined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\\r\\nceased speaking, replied thus:-- \"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have\\r\\nthe highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in\\r\\nall matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit\\r\\nme to say, that there must be a wide difference between the\\r\\nestablished forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\\r\\nwhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I\\r\\nconsider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the\\r\\nhighest rank in the kingdom-- provided that a proper humility of\\r\\nbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore\\r\\nallow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this\\r\\noccasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point\\r\\nof duty.  Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice,\\r\\nwhich on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though\\r\\nin the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\\r\\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady\\r\\nlike yourself.\"  And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched,\\r\\nand whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.\\r\\nHer cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though\\r\\nshe could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and\\r\\nsaw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\"\\r\\nand \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"  It vexed her to see him\\r\\nexpose himself to such a man.  Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\r\\nunrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him\\r\\ntime to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.  Mr. Collins,\\r\\nhowever, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length\\r\\nof his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a\\r\\nslight bow, and moved another way.  Mr. Collins then returned\\r\\nto Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with\\r\\nmy reception.  Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the\\r\\nattention.  He answered me with the utmost civility, and even\\r\\npaid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be certain she could never\\r\\nbestow a favour unworthily.  It was really a very handsome\\r\\nthought.  Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue,\\r\\nshe turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.\\r\\nBingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her\\r\\nobservations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as\\r\\nJane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the\\r\\nfelicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she\\r\\nfelt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to\\r\\nlike Bingley\\'s two sisters.  Her mother\\'s thoughts she plainly saw\\r\\nwere bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near\\r\\nher, lest she might hear too much.  When they sat down to\\r\\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness\\r\\nwhich placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she\\r\\nvexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person\\r\\n(Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her\\r\\nexpectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley.  It\\r\\nwas an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of\\r\\nfatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.  His\\r\\nbeing such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\\r\\nthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\\r\\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters\\r\\nwere of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the\\r\\nconnection as much as she could do.  It was, moreover, such a\\r\\npromising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\\'s marrying so\\r\\ngreatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly,\\r\\nit was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her\\r\\nsingle daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be\\r\\nobliged to go into company more than she liked.  It was\\r\\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure,\\r\\nbecause on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less\\r\\nlikely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any\\r\\nperiod of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that\\r\\nLady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate,  though evidently\\r\\nand triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her\\r\\nmother\\'s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less\\r\\naudible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could\\r\\nperceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who\\r\\nsat opposite to them.  Her mother only scolded her for being\\r\\nnonsensical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?\\r\\nI am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged\\r\\nto say nothing HE may not like to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it\\r\\nbe for you to offend Mr. Darcy?  You will never recommend\\r\\nyourself to his friend by so doing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence.  Her\\r\\nmother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.\\r\\nElizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.\\r\\nShe could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nthough every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for\\r\\nthough he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\r\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.  The\\r\\nexpression of his face changed gradually from indignant\\r\\ncontempt to a composed and steady gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady\\r\\nLucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights\\r\\nwhich she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts\\r\\nof cold ham and chicken.  Elizabeth now began to revive.  But\\r\\nnot long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was\\r\\nover, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of\\r\\nseeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the\\r\\ncompany.  By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did\\r\\nshe endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in\\r\\nvain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\\r\\nexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations,\\r\\nand she watched her progress through the several stanzas with\\r\\nan impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for\\r\\nMary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a\\r\\nhope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after\\r\\nthe pause of half a minute began another.  Mary\\'s powers were\\r\\nby no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and\\r\\nher manner affected.  Elizabeth was in agonies.  She looked at\\r\\nJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\\r\\ntalking to Bingley.  She looked at his two sisters, and saw them\\r\\nmaking signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who\\r\\ncontinued, however, imperturbably grave.  She looked at her\\r\\nfather to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all\\r\\nnight.  He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second\\r\\nsong, said aloud, \"That will do extremely well, child.  You have\\r\\ndelighted us long enough.  Let the other young ladies have time\\r\\nto exhibit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat\\r\\ndisconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her\\r\\nfather\\'s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.\\r\\nOthers of the party were now applied to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing,\\r\\nI should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company\\r\\nwith an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion,\\r\\nand perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.  I\\r\\ndo not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in\\r\\ndevoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly\\r\\nother things to be attended to.  The rector of a parish has much\\r\\nto do.  In the first place, he must make such an agreement for\\r\\ntithes as a may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his\\r\\npatron.  He must write his own sermons; and the time that\\r\\nremains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\r\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused\\r\\nfrom making as a comfortable as a possible.  And I do not think\\r\\nit of light importance that he should have attentive and\\r\\nconciliatory manner towards everybody, especially towards\\r\\nthose to whom he owes his preferment.  I cannot acquit him of\\r\\nthat duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\\r\\noccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected\\r\\nwith the family.\"  And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\\r\\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as a to be heard by\\r\\nhalf the room.  Many stared-- many smiled; but no one looked\\r\\nmore amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously\\r\\ncommended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and\\r\\nobserved in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a\\r\\nremarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement\\r\\nto expose themselves as a much as a they could during the\\r\\nevening, it would have been impossible for them to play their\\r\\nparts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it\\r\\nfor Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had\\r\\nescaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be\\r\\nmuch distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.\\r\\nThat his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such\\r\\nan opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and\\r\\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\\r\\ngentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more\\r\\nintolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement.  She was\\r\\nteased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her\\r\\nside, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him\\r\\nagain, put it out of her power to dance with others.  In vain did\\r\\nshe entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to\\r\\nintroduce him to any young lady in the room.  He assured her,\\r\\nthat as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his\\r\\nchief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\r\\nher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close\\r\\nto her the whole evening.  There was no arguing upon such a\\r\\nproject.  She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas,\\r\\nwho often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s conversation to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\\'s further\\r\\nnotice; though often standing within a very short distance of her,\\r\\nquite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.  She felt\\r\\nit to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.\\r\\nWickham, and rejoiced in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,\\r\\nand, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their\\r\\ncarriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,\\r\\nwhich gave them time to see how heartily they were wished\\r\\naway by some of the family.  Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely\\r\\nopened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were\\r\\nevidently impatient to have the house to themselves.  They\\r\\nrepulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by\\r\\nso doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very\\r\\nlittle relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was\\r\\ncomplimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of\\r\\ntheir entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had\\r\\nmarked their behaviour to their guests.  Darcy said nothing at all.\\r\\nMr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.  Mr.\\r\\nBingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from\\r\\nthe rest, and talked only to each other.  Elizabeth preserved as\\r\\nsteady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even\\r\\nLydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional\\r\\nexclamation of \"Lord, how tired I am!\" accompanied by a\\r\\nviolent yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most\\r\\npressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at\\r\\nLongbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to\\r\\nassure him how happy he would make them by eating a family\\r\\ndinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal\\r\\ninvitation.  Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily\\r\\nengaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,\\r\\nafter his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the\\r\\nnext day for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under\\r\\nthe delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary\\r\\npreparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,\\r\\nshe should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in\\r\\nthe course of three or four months.  Of having another daughter\\r\\nmarried to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and\\r\\nwith considerable, though not equal, pleasure.  Elizabeth was the\\r\\nleast dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the\\r\\nmatch were quite good enough for HER, the worth of each was\\r\\neclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 19\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmade his declaration in form.  Having resolved to do it without\\r\\nloss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the\\r\\nfollowing Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make\\r\\nit distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a\\r\\nvery orderly manner, with all the observances, which he\\r\\nsupposed a regular part of the business.  On finding Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\\r\\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: \"May I\\r\\nhope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter\\r\\nElizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience\\r\\nwith her in the course of this morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!-- yes-- certainly.  I\\r\\nam sure Lizzy will be very happy-- I am sure she can have no\\r\\nobjection, Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.\"  And, gathering\\r\\nher work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\\r\\ncalled out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam, do not go.  I beg you will not go.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmust excuse me.  He can have nothing to say to me that anybody\\r\\nneed not hear.  I am going away myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.  I desire you to stay where you are.\"\\r\\nAnd upon Elizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and\\r\\nembarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \"Lizzy, I\\r\\nINSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth would not oppose such and injunction-- and a\\r\\nmoment\\'s consideration making her also sensible that it would\\r\\nbe wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat\\r\\ndown again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the\\r\\nfeelings which were divided between distress and diversion.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were\\r\\ngone, Mr. Collins began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far\\r\\nfrom doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other\\r\\nperfections.  You would have been less amiable in my eyes had\\r\\nthere NOT been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure\\r\\nyou, that I have your respected mother\\'s permission for this\\r\\naddress.  You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,\\r\\nhowever your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my\\r\\nattentions have been too marked to be mistaken.  Almost as\\r\\nsoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion\\r\\nof my future life.  But before I am run away with by my feelings\\r\\non this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state\\r\\nmy reasons for marrying-- and, moreover, for coming into\\r\\nHertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being\\r\\nrun away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing,\\r\\nthat she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt\\r\\nto stop him further, and he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing\\r\\nfor every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set\\r\\nthe example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am\\r\\nconvinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and\\r\\nthirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it\\r\\nis the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble\\r\\nlady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice has\\r\\nshe condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\\r\\nsubject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\\r\\nHunsford-- between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson\\r\\nwas arranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said,  \\'Mr.\\r\\nCollins, you must marry.  A clergyman like you must marry.\\r\\nChoose properly, choose a gentlewoman for MY sake; and for\\r\\nyour OWN, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought\\r\\nup high, but able to make a small income go a good way.  This is\\r\\nmy advice.  Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to\\r\\nHunsford, and I will visit her.\\'  Allow me, by the way, to\\r\\nobserve, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\r\\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\r\\nadvantages in my power to offer.  You will find her manners\\r\\nbeyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I\\r\\nthink, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with\\r\\nthe silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.\\r\\nThus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it\\r\\nremains to be told why my views were directed towards\\r\\nLongbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can\\r\\nassure you there are many amiable young women.  But the fact\\r\\nis, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of\\r\\nyour honoured father (who, however, may live many years\\r\\nlonger), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a\\r\\nwife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as\\r\\nlittle as possible, when the melancholy event takes place-- which,\\r\\nhowever, as I have already said, may not be for several years.\\r\\nThis has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it\\r\\nwill not sink me in your esteem.  And now nothing remains but\\r\\nfor me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\r\\nviolence of my affection.  To fortune I am perfectly indifferent,\\r\\nand shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I\\r\\nam well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one\\r\\nthousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours\\r\\ntill after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be\\r\\nentitled to.  On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent;\\r\\nand you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall\\r\\never pass my lips when we are married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried.  \"You forget that I have\\r\\nmade no answer.  Let me do it without further loss of time.\\r\\nAccept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.  I am\\r\\nvery sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is\\r\\nimpossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave\\r\\nof the hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the\\r\\naddresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when\\r\\nhe first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is\\r\\nrepeated a second, or even a third time.  I am therefore by no\\r\\nmeans discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to\\r\\nlead you to the altar ere long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\\r\\nextraordinary one after my declaration.  I do assure you that I\\r\\nam not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)\\r\\nwho are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of\\r\\nbeing asked a second time.  I am perfectly serious in my refusal.\\r\\nYou could not make ME happy, and I am convinced that I am\\r\\nthe last woman in the world who could make you so.  Nay, were\\r\\nyour friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she\\r\\nwould find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr.\\r\\nCollins very gravely-- \"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship\\r\\nwould at all disapprove of you.  And you may be certain when I\\r\\nhave the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very\\r\\nhighest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable\\r\\nqualification.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.  You\\r\\nmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the\\r\\ncompliment of believing what I say.  I wish you very happy and\\r\\nvery rich, and by refusing you hand, do all in my power to\\r\\nprevent your being otherwise.  In making me the offer, you must\\r\\nhave satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my\\r\\nfamily, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever\\r\\nit falls, without any self-reproach.  This matter may be\\r\\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.\"  And rising as she thus\\r\\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not\\r\\nthus addressed her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the\\r\\nsubject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than\\r\\nyou have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of\\r\\ncruelty at present, because I know it to be the established\\r\\ncustom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and\\r\\nperhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit\\r\\nas would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female\\r\\ncharacter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you\\r\\npuzzle me exceedingly.  If what I have hitherto said can appear\\r\\nto you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express\\r\\nmy refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that\\r\\nyour refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.  My\\r\\nreasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to\\r\\nme that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the\\r\\nestablishment I can offer would be any other than highly\\r\\ndesirable.  My situation in life, my connections with the family of\\r\\nde Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances\\r\\nhighly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\r\\nconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by\\r\\nno means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be\\r\\nmade you.  Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all\\r\\nlikelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable\\r\\nqualifications.  As I must therefore conclude that you are not\\r\\nserious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to\\r\\nyour wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the\\r\\nusual practice of elegant females.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that\\r\\nkind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.\\r\\nI would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.\\r\\nI thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in\\r\\nyour proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.  My\\r\\nfeelings in every respect forbid it.  Can I speak plainer?  Do not\\r\\nconsider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you,\\r\\nbut as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\\r\\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the\\r\\nexpress authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals\\r\\nwill not fail of being acceptable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would\\r\\nmake no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew,\\r\\ndetermined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated\\r\\nrefusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father,\\r\\nwhose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be\\r\\ndecisive, and whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for\\r\\nthe affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 20\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\r\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the\\r\\nvestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw\\r\\nElizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards\\r\\nthe staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and\\r\\ncongratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy\\r\\nprospect or their nearer connection.  Mr. Collins received and\\r\\nreturned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\r\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the\\r\\nresult of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied,\\r\\nsince the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him\\r\\nwould naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine\\r\\ndelicacy of her character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would\\r\\nhave been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had\\r\\nmeant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but\\r\\nshe dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall\\r\\nbe brought to reason.  I will speak to her about it directly.  She\\r\\nis a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own\\r\\ninterest but I will MAKE her know it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr. Collins;\\r\\n\"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether\\r\\nshe would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my\\r\\nsituation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage\\r\\nstate.  If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,\\r\\nperhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,\\r\\nbecause if liable to such defects of temper, she could not\\r\\ncontribute much to my felicity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.\\r\\n\"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.  In everything\\r\\nelse she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.  I will go directly\\r\\nto Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am\\r\\nsure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to\\r\\nher husband, called out as she entered the library, \"Oh! Mr.\\r\\nBennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\\r\\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows\\r\\nshe will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will\\r\\nchange his mind and not have HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and\\r\\nfixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in\\r\\nthe least altered by her communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when\\r\\nshe had finished her speech.  \"Of what are you talking?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.  Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have\\r\\nLizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?  It seems an hopeless\\r\\nbusiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.  Tell her that you insist upon\\r\\nher marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let her be called down.  She shall hear my opinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to\\r\\nthe library.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared.  \"I have\\r\\nsent for you on an affair of importance.  I understand that Mr.\\r\\nCollins has made you an offer of marriage.  Is it true?\"  Elizabeth\\r\\nreplied that it was.  \"Very well-- and this offer of marriage you\\r\\nhave refused?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  We now come to the point.  Your mother insists\\r\\nupon your accepting it.  Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.  From this day\\r\\nyou must be a stranger to one of your parents.  Your mother will\\r\\nnever see you again if you do NOT marry Mr. Collins, and I will\\r\\nnever see you again if you DO.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a\\r\\nbeginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her\\r\\nhusband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively\\r\\ndisappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?  You\\r\\npromised me to INSIST upon her marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to\\r\\nrequest.  First, that you will allow me the free use of my\\r\\nunderstanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my\\r\\nroom.  I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as\\r\\nmay be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,\\r\\ndid Mrs. Bennet give up the point.  She talked to Elizabeth again\\r\\nand again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.  She endeavoured\\r\\nto secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible\\r\\nmildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with\\r\\nreal earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to\\r\\nher attacks.  Though her manner varied, however, her\\r\\ndetermination never did.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had\\r\\npassed.  He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what\\r\\nmotives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was\\r\\nhurt, he suffered in no other way.  His regard for her was quite\\r\\nimaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother\\'s\\r\\nreproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to\\r\\nspend the day with them.  She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,\\r\\nwho, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are\\r\\ncome, for there is such fun here!  What do you think has\\r\\nhappened this morning?  Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy,\\r\\nand she will not have him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by\\r\\nKitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they\\r\\nentered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than\\r\\nshe likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her\\r\\ncompassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to\\r\\ncomply with the wishes of all her family.  \"Pray do, my dear\\r\\nMiss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone, \"for nobody is on\\r\\nmy side, nobody takes part with me.  I am cruelly used, nobody\\r\\nfeels for my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as\\r\\nunconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we\\r\\nwere at York, provided she can have her own way.  But I tell\\r\\nyou, Miss Lizzy-- if you take it into your head to go on refusing\\r\\nevery offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband\\r\\nat all-- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  I shall not be able to keep you--\\r\\nand so I warn you.  I have done with you from this very day.  I\\r\\ntold you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to\\r\\nyou again, and you will find me as good as my word.  I have no\\r\\npleasure in talking to undutiful children.  Not that I have much\\r\\npleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.  People who suffer as I\\r\\ndo from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for\\r\\ntalking.  Nobody can tell what I suffer!  But it is always so.\\r\\nThose who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\r\\nany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only\\r\\nincrease the irritation.  She talked on, therefore, without\\r\\ninterruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.\\r\\nCollins, who entered the room with an air more stately than\\r\\nusual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, \"Now, I do\\r\\ninsist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me\\r\\nand Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty\\r\\nfollowed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she\\r\\ncould; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nwhose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute,\\r\\nand then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the\\r\\nwindow and pretending not to hear.  In a doleful voice Mrs.\\r\\nBennet began the projected conversation: \"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam, \" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this\\r\\npoint.  Far be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a voice that\\r\\nmarked his displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter.\\r\\nResignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the\\r\\npeculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I\\r\\nhave been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.\\r\\nPerhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive\\r\\nhappiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\\r\\nhave often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when\\r\\nthe blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\r\\nestimation.  You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any\\r\\ndisrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing\\r\\nmy pretensions to your daughter\\'s favour, without having paid\\r\\nyourself and Mr. Bennet to compliment of requesting you to\\r\\ninterpose your authority in my behalf.  My conduct may, I fear,\\r\\nbe objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your\\r\\ndaughter\\'s lips instead of your own.  But we are all liable to\\r\\nerror.  I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.  My\\r\\nobject has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with\\r\\ndue consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my\\r\\nMANNER has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to\\r\\napologise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 21\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins\\'s offer was now nearly at an end,\\r\\nand Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings\\r\\nnecessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish\\r\\nallusions of her mother.  As for the gentleman himself, HIS\\r\\nfeelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or\\r\\ndejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner\\r\\nand resentful silence.  He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the\\r\\nassiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself\\r\\nwere transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\r\\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\r\\nespecially to her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\\'s ill-humour\\r\\nor ill health.  Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry\\r\\npride.  Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his\\r\\nvisit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.  He\\r\\nwas always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant\\r\\nto stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.\\r\\nWickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from\\r\\nthe Netherfield ball.  He joined them on their entering the town,\\r\\nand attended them to their aunt\\'s where his regret and vexation,\\r\\nand the concern of everybody, was well talked over.  To\\r\\nElizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the\\r\\nnecessity of his absence HAD been self-imposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better not\\r\\nmeet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party\\r\\nwith him for so many hours together, might be more than I could\\r\\nbear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a\\r\\nfull discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they\\r\\ncivilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer\\r\\nwalked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he\\r\\nparticularly attended to her.  His accompanying them was a\\r\\ndouble advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to\\r\\nherself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing\\r\\nhim to her father and mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it\\r\\ncame from Netherfield.  The envelope contained a sheet of\\r\\nelegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\'s fair,\\r\\nflowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\\'s countenance change\\r\\nas she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular\\r\\npassages.  Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter\\r\\naway, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general\\r\\nconversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which\\r\\ndrew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had\\r\\nhe and he companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\\r\\ninvited her to follow her upstairs.  When they had gained their\\r\\nown room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, \"This is from\\r\\nCaroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\\r\\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\\r\\ntheir way to town-- and without any intention of coming back\\r\\nagain.  You shall hear what she says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the\\r\\ninformation of their having just resolved to follow their brother\\r\\nto town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet, where Mr. Hurst had a house.  The next was in these\\r\\nwords: \"I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in\\r\\nHertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we\\r\\nwill hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\r\\ndelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\r\\nlessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\r\\nunreserved correspondence.  I depend on you for that.\"  To\\r\\nthese highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the\\r\\ninsensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their\\r\\nremoval surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it\\r\\nwas not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield\\r\\nwould prevent Mr. Bingley\\'s being there; and as to the loss of\\r\\ntheir society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard\\r\\nit, in the enjoyment of his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should\\r\\nnot be able to see your friends before they leave the country.\\r\\nBut may we not hope that the period of future happiness to\\r\\nwhich Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is\\r\\naware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as\\r\\nfriends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?\\r\\nMr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\r\\nHertfordshire this winter.  I will read it to you:\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the\\r\\nbusiness which took him to London might be concluded in three\\r\\nor four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the\\r\\nsame time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be\\r\\nin no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following\\r\\nhim thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours\\r\\nin a comfortless hotel.  Many of my acquaintances are already\\r\\nthere for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest\\r\\nfriend, had any intention of making one of the crowd-- but of\\r\\nthat I despair.  I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire\\r\\nmay abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings,\\r\\nand that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your\\r\\nfeeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more\\r\\nthis winter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he\\r\\nSHOULD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why will you think so?  It must be his own doing.  He is his\\r\\nown master.  But you do not know ALL.  I WILL read you the\\r\\npassage which particularly hurts me.  I will have no reserves\\r\\nfrom YOU.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the\\r\\ntruth, WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again.  I really do\\r\\nnot think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,\\r\\nand accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa\\r\\nand myself is heightened into something still more interesting,\\r\\nfrom the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our\\r\\nsister.  I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you\\r\\nmy feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country\\r\\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\r\\nunreasonable.  My brother admires her greatly already; he will\\r\\nhave frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most\\r\\nintimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as\\r\\nhis own; and a sister\\'s partiality is not misleading me, I think,\\r\\nwhen I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman\\'s\\r\\nheart.  With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and\\r\\nnothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging\\r\\nthe hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think of THIS sentence, my dear Lizzy?\" said\\r\\nJane as she finished it.  \"Is it not clear enough?  Does it not\\r\\nexpressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to\\r\\nbe her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother\\'s\\r\\nindifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for\\r\\nhim, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?  Can\\r\\nthere be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.  Will you hear it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou shall have it in a few words.  Miss Bingley sees that her\\r\\nbrother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.\\r\\nShe follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries\\r\\nto persuade you that he does not care about you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.  No one who has ever\\r\\nseen you together can doubt his affection.  Miss Bingley, I am\\r\\nsure, cannot.  She is not such a simpleton.  Could she have seen\\r\\nhalf as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have\\r\\nordered her wedding clothes.  But the case is this: We are not\\r\\nrich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more\\r\\nanxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\\r\\nwhen there has been ONE intermarriage, she may have less\\r\\ntrouble in achieving a second: in which there is certainly some\\r\\ningenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nwere out of the way.  But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously\\r\\nimagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly\\r\\nadmires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of\\r\\nYOUR merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or\\r\\nthat it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being\\r\\nin love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\r\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy.  But I know\\r\\nthe foundation is unjust.  Caroline is incapable of wilfully\\r\\ndeceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she\\r\\nis deceiving herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is right.  You could not have started a more happy idea,\\r\\nsince you will not take comfort in mine.  Believe her to be\\r\\ndeceived, by all means.  You have now done your duty by her,\\r\\nand must fret no longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\r\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to\\r\\nmarry elsewhere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if, upon\\r\\nmature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his\\r\\ntwo sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his\\r\\nwife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling.  \"You must\\r\\nknow that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their\\r\\ndisapprobation, I could not hesitate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot\\r\\nconsider your situation with much compassion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\r\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the\\r\\nutmost contempt.  It appeared to her merely the suggestion of\\r\\nCaroline\\'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment\\r\\nsuppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,\\r\\ncould influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\\r\\non the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy\\r\\neffect.  Jane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was\\r\\ngradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection\\r\\nsometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to\\r\\nNetherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure\\r\\nof the family, without being alarmed on the score of the\\r\\ngentleman\\'s conduct; but even this partial communication gave\\r\\nher a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly\\r\\nunlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they\\r\\nwere all getting so intimate together.  After lamenting it,\\r\\nhowever, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\\r\\nBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at\\r\\nLongbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable\\r\\ndeclaration, that though he had been invited only to a family\\r\\ndinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 22\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again\\r\\nduring the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to\\r\\nMr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.  \"It\\r\\nkeeps him in good humour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to\\r\\nyou than I can express.\"  Charlotte assured her friend of her\\r\\nsatisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the\\r\\nlittle sacrifice of her time.  This was very amiable, but\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any\\r\\nconception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\r\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins\\'s addresses, by engaging them\\r\\ntowards herself.  Such was Miss Lucas\\'s scheme; and\\r\\nappearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night,\\r\\nshe would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been\\r\\nto leave Hertfordshire so very soon.  But here she did injustice\\r\\nto the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to\\r\\nescape out of Longbourn House the next morning with\\r\\nadmirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself\\r\\nat her feet.  He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\r\\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail\\r\\nto conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the\\r\\nattempt known till its success might be known likewise; for\\r\\nthough feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had\\r\\nbeen tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since\\r\\nthe adventure of Wednesday.  His reception, however, was of\\r\\nthe most flattering kind.  Miss Lucas perceived him from an\\r\\nupper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set\\r\\nout to meet him accidentally in the lane.  But little had she dared\\r\\nto hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins\\'s long speeches would allow,\\r\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;\\r\\nand as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name\\r\\nthe day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though\\r\\nsuch a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt\\r\\nno inclination to trifle with his happiness.  The stupidity with\\r\\nwhich he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from\\r\\nany charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance;\\r\\nand Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\\r\\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\r\\nestablishment were gained.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their\\r\\nconsent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.  Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for\\r\\ntheir daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his\\r\\nprospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nbegan directly to calculate, with more interest than the\\r\\nmatter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr.\\r\\nBennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\\r\\nopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\r\\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and\\r\\nhis wife should make their appearance at St. James\\'s. The whole\\r\\nfamily, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.  The\\r\\nyounger girls formed hopes of COMING OUT a year or two\\r\\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were\\r\\nrelieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\\'s dying an old\\r\\nmaid.  Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.  She had\\r\\ngained her point, and had time to consider of it.  Her reflections\\r\\nwere in general satisfactory.  Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither\\r\\nsensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\\r\\nattachment to her must be imaginary.  But still he would be her\\r\\nhusband.  Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,\\r\\nmarriage had always been her object; it was the only provision\\r\\nfor well-educated young women of small fortune, and however\\r\\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\r\\npreservative from want.  This preservative she had now\\r\\nobtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever\\r\\nbeen handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.  The least\\r\\nagreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must\\r\\noccasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued\\r\\nbeyond that of any other person.  Elizabeth would wonder, and\\r\\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to\\r\\nbe shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.\\r\\nShe resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore\\r\\ncharged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,\\r\\nto drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.  A\\r\\npromise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it\\r\\ncould not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by\\r\\nhis long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his\\r\\nreturn as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the\\r\\nsame time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\r\\npublish his prosperous love.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see\\r\\nany of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed\\r\\nwhen the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with\\r\\ngreat politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to\\r\\nsee him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might\\r\\nallow him to visit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\\r\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\r\\nyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no\\r\\nmeans wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation\\r\\nhere, my good sir?  You had better neglect your relations than\\r\\nrun the risk of offending your patroness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins,\" I am particularly obliged to\\r\\nyou for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not\\r\\ntaking so material a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be too much upon your guard.  Risk anything\\r\\nrather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by\\r\\nyour coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly\\r\\nprobable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that WE shall\\r\\ntake no offence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited, by\\r\\nsuch affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily\\r\\nreceive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other\\r\\nmark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.  As for my\\r\\nfair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to\\r\\nrender it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them\\r\\nhealth and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them\\r\\nequally surprised that he meditated a quick return.  Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwished to understand by it that he thought of paying his\\r\\naddresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been\\r\\nprevailed on to accept him.  She rated his abilities much higher\\r\\nthan any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections\\r\\nwhich often struck her, and though by no means so clever as\\r\\nherself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve\\r\\nhimself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\r\\nagreeable companion.  But on the following morning, every\\r\\nhope of this kind was done away.  Miss Lucas called soon after\\r\\nbreakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the\\r\\nevent of the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins\\'s fancying herself in love with her\\r\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two;\\r\\nbut that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far\\r\\nfrom possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her\\r\\nastonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first\\r\\nthe bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins!  My dear Charlotte-- impossible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in\\r\\ntelling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on\\r\\nreceiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than\\r\\nshe expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly\\r\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?  Do you think it\\r\\nincredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any\\r\\nwoman\\'s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to\\r\\nsucceed with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong\\r\\neffort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the\\r\\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that\\r\\nshe wished her all imaginable happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte.  \"You must be\\r\\nsurprised, very much surprised-- so lately as Mr. Collins was\\r\\nwishing to marry you.  But when you have had time to think it\\r\\nover, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.  I am\\r\\nnot romantic, you know; I never was.  I ask only a comfortable\\r\\nhome; and considering Mr. Collins\\'s character, connection, and\\r\\nsituation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness\\r\\nwith him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the\\r\\nmarriage state.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly\"; and after an\\r\\nawkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.\\r\\nCharlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left\\r\\nto reflect on what she had heard.  It was a long time before she\\r\\nbecame at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.\\r\\nThe strangeness of Mr. Collins\\'s making two offers of marriage\\r\\nwithin three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\r\\naccepted.  She had always felt that Charlotte\\'s opinion of\\r\\nmatrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not\\r\\nsupposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she\\r\\nwould have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.\\r\\nCharlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture!\\r\\nAnd to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her\\r\\nesteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was\\r\\nimpossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\\r\\nchosen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 23\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on\\r\\nwhat she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to\\r\\nmention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his\\r\\ndaughter, to announce her engagement to the family.  With many\\r\\ncompliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect\\r\\nof a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter-- to\\r\\nan audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he\\r\\nmust be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\\r\\noften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?  Do not\\r\\nyou know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have\\r\\nborne without anger such treatment; but Sir William\\'s good\\r\\nbreeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave\\r\\nto be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all\\r\\ntheir impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so\\r\\nunpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his\\r\\naccount, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte\\r\\nherself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her\\r\\nmother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to\\r\\nSir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by\\r\\nmaking a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be\\r\\nexpected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nand the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great\\r\\ndeal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them\\r\\nthan her feelings found a rapid vent.  In the first place, she\\r\\npersisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she\\r\\nwas very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she\\r\\ntrusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,\\r\\nthat the match might be broken off.  Two inferences, however,\\r\\nwere plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was\\r\\nthe real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had\\r\\nbeen barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points\\r\\nshe principally dwelt during the rest of the day.  Nothing could\\r\\nconsole and nothing could appease her.  Nor did that day wear\\r\\nout her resentment.  A week elapsed before she could see\\r\\nElizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she\\r\\ncould speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude,\\r\\nand many months were gone before she could at all forgive her\\r\\ndaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s emotions were much more tranquil on the\\r\\noccasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of\\r\\na most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover\\r\\nthat Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably\\r\\nsensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his\\r\\ndaughter!\\r\\n\\r\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\\r\\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their\\r\\nhappiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as\\r\\nimprobable.  Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,\\r\\nfor Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no\\r\\nother way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to\\r\\nretort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well\\r\\nmarried; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual\\r\\nto say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet\\'s sour looks and\\r\\nill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which\\r\\nkept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt\\r\\npersuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between\\r\\nthem again.  Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with\\r\\nfonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she\\r\\nwas sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose\\r\\nhappiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been\\r\\ngone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was\\r\\ncounting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\\r\\nThe promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on\\r\\nTuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the\\r\\nsolemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth\\'s abode in the\\r\\nfamily might have prompted.  After discharging his conscience\\r\\non that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous\\r\\nexpressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of\\r\\ntheir amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it\\r\\nwas merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\\r\\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again\\r\\nat Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday\\r\\nfortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved\\r\\nhis marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,\\r\\nwhich he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his\\r\\namiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\r\\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet.  On the contrary, she was as much\\r\\ndisposed to complain of it as her husband.  It was very strange\\r\\nthat he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it\\r\\nwas also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.  She\\r\\nhated having visitors in the house while her health was so\\r\\nindifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.\\r\\nSuch were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave\\r\\nway only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\\'s continued\\r\\nabsence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.\\r\\nDay after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of\\r\\nhim than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his\\r\\ncoming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which\\r\\nhighly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to\\r\\ncontradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear-- not that Bingley was indifferent--\\r\\nbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\\r\\nUnwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\\'s\\r\\nhappiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she\\r\\ncould not prevent its frequently occurring.  The united efforts of\\r\\nhis two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted\\r\\nby the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London\\r\\nmight be too much, she feared, for the strength of his\\r\\nattachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Jane, HER anxiety under this suspense was, of course,\\r\\nmore painful than Elizabeth\\'s, but whatever she felt she was\\r\\ndesirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,\\r\\ntherefore, the subject was never alluded to.  But as no such\\r\\ndelicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which\\r\\nshe did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival,\\r\\nor even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she\\r\\nwould think herself very ill used.  It needed all Jane\\'s steady\\r\\nmildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but\\r\\nhis reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had\\r\\nbeen on his first introduction.  He was too happy, however, to\\r\\nneed much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of\\r\\nlove-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.\\r\\nThe chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he\\r\\nsometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an\\r\\napology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.  The very\\r\\nmention of anything concerning the match threw her into an\\r\\nagony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of\\r\\nhearing it talked of.  The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.\\r\\nAs her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous\\r\\nabhorrence.  Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she\\r\\nconcluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\r\\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was\\r\\nconvinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and\\r\\nresolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as\\r\\nsoon as Mr. Bennet were dead.  She complained bitterly of all\\r\\nthis to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I\\r\\nshould be forced to make way for HER, and live to see her take\\r\\nher place in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.  Let us\\r\\nhope for better things.  Let us flatter ourselves that I may be\\r\\nthe survivor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead\\r\\nof making any answer, she went on as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.  If it\\r\\nwas not for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What should not you mind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\r\\ninsensibility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the\\r\\nentail.  How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an\\r\\nestate from one\\'s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all\\r\\nfor the sake of Mr. Collins too!  Why should HE have it more\\r\\nthan anybody else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 24\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.  The very\\r\\nfirst sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in\\r\\nLondon for the winter, and concluded with her brother\\'s regret\\r\\nat not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in\\r\\nHertfordshire before he left the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the\\r\\nrest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection\\r\\nof the writer, that could give her any comfort.  Miss Darcy\\'s\\r\\npraise occupied the chief of it.  Her many attractions were again\\r\\ndwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing\\r\\nintimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the\\r\\nwishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.  She wrote\\r\\nalso with great pleasure of her brother\\'s being an inmate of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the\\r\\nlatter with regard to new furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of\\r\\nall this, heard it in silent indignation.  Her heart was divided\\r\\nbetween concern for her sister, and resentment against all others.\\r\\nTo Caroline\\'s assertion of her brother\\'s being partial to Miss\\r\\nDarcy she paid no credit.  That he was really fond of Jane, she\\r\\ndoubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had\\r\\nalways been disposed to like him, she could not think without\\r\\nanger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that\\r\\nwant of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his\\r\\ndesigning friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\r\\nto the caprice of their inclination.  Had his own happiness,\\r\\nhowever, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to\\r\\nsport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister\\'s\\r\\nwas involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.  It\\r\\nwas a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long\\r\\nindulged, and must be unavailing.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nelse; and yet whether Bingley\\'s regard had really died away, or\\r\\nwere suppressed by his friends\\' interference; whether he had\\r\\nbeen aware of Jane\\'s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\r\\nobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him\\r\\nmust be materially affected by the difference, her sister\\'s\\r\\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her\\r\\nfeelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\\'s leaving them\\r\\ntogether, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield\\r\\nand its master, she could not help saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!  She\\r\\ncan have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual\\r\\nreflections on him.  But I will not repine.  It cannot last long.  He\\r\\nwill be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but\\r\\nsaid nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you\\r\\nhave no reason.  He may live in my memory as the most amiable\\r\\nman of my acquaintance, but that is all.  I have nothing either to\\r\\nhope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.  Thank God! I\\r\\nhave not THAT pain. A little time, therefore-- I shall certainly\\r\\ntry to get the better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort\\r\\nimmediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on\\r\\nmy side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good.  Your\\r\\nsweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know\\r\\nwhat to say to you.  I feel as if I had never done you justice, or\\r\\nloved you as you deserve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and\\r\\nthrew back the praise on her sister\\'s warm affection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair.  YOU wish to think all\\r\\nthe world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I\\r\\nonly want to think YOU perfect, and you set yourself against it.\\r\\nDo not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my\\r\\nencroaching on your privilege of universal good-will.  You need\\r\\nnot.  There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of\\r\\nwhom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I\\r\\ndissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the\\r\\ninconsistency of all human characters, and of the little\\r\\ndependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\r\\nsense.  I have met with two instances lately, one I will not\\r\\nmention; the other is Charlotte\\'s marriage.  It is unaccountable!\\r\\nIn every view it is unaccountable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.  They\\r\\nwill ruin your happiness.  You do not make allowance enough\\r\\nfor difference of situation and temper.  Consider Mr. Collins\\'s\\r\\nrespectability, and Charlotte\\'s steady, prudent character.\\r\\nRemember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it\\r\\nis a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\\'s\\r\\nsake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our\\r\\ncousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no\\r\\none else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I\\r\\npersuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only\\r\\nthink worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.\\r\\nMy dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-\\r\\nminded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must\\r\\nfeel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot\\r\\nhave a proper way of thinking.  You shall not defend her, though\\r\\nit is Charlotte Lucas.  You shall not, for the sake of one\\r\\nindividual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor\\r\\nendeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is\\r\\nprudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I musty think your language too strong in speaking of both,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing\\r\\nthem happy together.  But enough of this.  You alluded to\\r\\nsomething else.  You mentioned TWO instances.  I cannot\\r\\nmisunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me\\r\\nby thinking THAT PERSON to blame, and saying your opinion\\r\\nof him is sunk.  We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves\\r\\nintentionally injured.  We must not expect a lively young man to\\r\\nbe always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing\\r\\nbut our own vanity that deceives us.  Women fancy admiration\\r\\nmeans more than it does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no\\r\\nidea of there being so much design in the world as some persons\\r\\nimagine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\'s conduct to\\r\\ndesign,\" said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or\\r\\nto make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be\\r\\nmisery.  Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people\\'s\\r\\nfeelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; to the last.  But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying\\r\\nwhat I think of persons you esteem Stop me whilst you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot believe it.  Why should they try to influence him?\\r\\nThey can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no\\r\\nother woman can secure it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your first position is false.  They may wish many things besides\\r\\nhis happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and\\r\\nconsequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the\\r\\nimportance of money, great connections, and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings than you are\\r\\nsupposing.  They have known her much longer than they have\\r\\nknown me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever\\r\\nmay be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have\\r\\nopposed their brother\\'s.  What sister would think herself at\\r\\nliberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?\\r\\nIf they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part\\r\\nus; if he were so, they could not succeed.  By supposing such an\\r\\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong,\\r\\nand me most unhappy.  Do not distress me by the idea.  I am not\\r\\nashamed of having been mistaken-- or, at least, it is light, it is\\r\\nnothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him\\r\\nor his sisters.  Let me take it in the best light, in the light in\\r\\nwhich it may be understood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.\\r\\nBingley\\'s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning\\r\\nno more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did\\r\\nnot account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever\\r\\nconsidering it with less perplexity.  Her daughter endeavoured to\\r\\nconvince her of what she did not believe herself, that his\\r\\nattentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and\\r\\ntransient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but\\r\\nthough the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,\\r\\nshe had the same story to repeat every day.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s best\\r\\ncomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the\\r\\nsummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently.  \"So, Lizzy,\" said he\\r\\none day, \"your sister is crossed in love, I find.  I congratulate\\r\\nher.  Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in\\r\\nlove now and then.  It is something to think of, and it gives her a\\r\\nsort of distinction among her companions.  When is your turn to\\r\\ncome?  You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.  Now is\\r\\nyour time.  Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all\\r\\nthe young ladies in the country.  Let Wickham be your man.  He\\r\\nis a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.  We\\r\\nmust not all expect Jane\\'s good fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that\\r\\nwhatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate\\r\\nmother who will make the most of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s society was of material service in dispelling the\\r\\ngloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many\\r\\nof the Longbourn family.  They saw him often, and to his other\\r\\nrecommendations was now added that of general unreserve.\\r\\nThe whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on\\r\\nMr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now\\r\\nopenly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody\\r\\nwas pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr.\\r\\nDarcy before they had known anything of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there\\r\\nmight be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to\\r\\nthe society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always\\r\\npleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--\\r\\nbut by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 25\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\\r\\nMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival\\r\\nof Saturday.  The pain of separation, however, might be\\r\\nalleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his\\r\\nbride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into\\r\\nHertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.  He took leave of his relations at Longbourn\\r\\nwith as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health\\r\\nand happiness again, and promised their father another letter of\\r\\nthanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of\\r\\nreceiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend\\r\\nthe Christmas at Longbourn.  Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by\\r\\nnature as education.  The Netherfield ladies would have had\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within\\r\\nview of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and\\r\\nagreeable.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent,\\r\\nelegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn\\r\\nnieces.  Between the two eldest and herself especially, there\\r\\nsubsisted a particular regard.  They had frequently been staying\\r\\nwith her in town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s business on her arrival was to\\r\\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.  When\\r\\nthis was done she had a less active part to play.  It became her\\r\\nturn to listen.  Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and\\r\\nmuch to complain of.  They had all been very ill-used since she\\r\\nlast saw her sister.  Two of her girls had been upon the point of\\r\\nmarriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got\\r\\nMr. Bingley if she could.  But Lizzy!  Oh, sister!  It is very hard\\r\\nto think that she might have been Mr. Collins\\'s wife by this time,\\r\\nhad it not been for her own perverseness.  He made her an offer\\r\\nin this very room, and she refused him.  The consequence of it is,\\r\\nthat Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and\\r\\nthat the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.  The\\r\\nLucases are very artful people indeed, sister.  They are all for\\r\\nwhat they can get.  I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.  It\\r\\nmakes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own\\r\\nfamily, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before\\r\\nanybody else.  However, your coming just at this time is the\\r\\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us,\\r\\nof long sleeves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given\\r\\nbefore, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\\'s correspondence\\r\\nwith her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to\\r\\nher nieces, turned the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the\\r\\nsubject.  \"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for\\r\\nJane,\" said she.  \"I am sorry it went off.  But these things happen\\r\\nso often!  A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so\\r\\neasily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when\\r\\naccident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of\\r\\ninconsistencies are very frequent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will\\r\\nnot do for US.  We do not suffer by accident.  It does not often\\r\\nhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young\\r\\nman of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he\\r\\nwas violently in love with only a few days before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that expression of \\'violently in love\\' is so hackneyed, so\\r\\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.  It is as\\r\\noften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\\'s\\r\\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.  Pray, how\\r\\nVIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley\\'s love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\r\\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.  Every\\r\\ntime they met, it was more decided and remarkable.  At his own\\r\\nball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them\\r\\nto dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an\\r\\nanswer. Could there be finer symptoms?  Is not general incivility\\r\\nthe very essence of love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.\\r\\nPoor Jane!  I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she\\r\\nmay not get over it immediately.  It had better have happened to\\r\\nYOU, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.\\r\\nBut do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with\\r\\nus?  Change of scene might be of service-- and perhaps a little\\r\\nrelief from home may be as useful as anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt\\r\\npersuaded of her sister\\'s ready acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with\\r\\nregard to this young man will influence her.  We live in so\\r\\ndifferent a part of town, all our connections are so different, and,\\r\\nas you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable\\r\\nthat they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And THAT is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of\\r\\nhis friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on\\r\\nJane in such a part of London!  My dear aunt, how could you\\r\\nthink of it?  Mr. Darcy may perhaps have HEARD of such a\\r\\nplace as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a\\r\\nmonth\\'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were\\r\\nhe once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs\\r\\nwithout him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  I hope they will not meet at all.  But does\\r\\nnot Jane correspond with his sister?  SHE will not be able to\\r\\nhelp calling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place\\r\\nthis point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\\'s\\r\\nbeing withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the\\r\\nsubject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not\\r\\nconsider it entirely hopeless.  It was possible, and sometimes she\\r\\nthought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and\\r\\nthe influence of his friends successfully combated by the more\\r\\nnatural influence of Jane\\'s attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt\\'s invitation with pleasure; and\\r\\nthe Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time,\\r\\nthan as she hoped by Caroline\\'s not living in the same house\\r\\nwith her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with\\r\\nher, without any danger of seeing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the\\r\\nPhillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day\\r\\nwithout its engagement.  Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided\\r\\nfor the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not\\r\\nonce sit down to a family dinner.  When the engagement was for\\r\\nhome, some of the officers always made part of it-- of which\\r\\nofficers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these\\r\\noccasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nwarm commendation, narrowly observed them both.  Without\\r\\nsupposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love,\\r\\ntheir preference of each other was plain enough to make her a\\r\\nlittle uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the\\r\\nsubject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the\\r\\nimprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording\\r\\npleasure, unconnected with his general powers.  About ten or a\\r\\ndozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a\\r\\nconsiderable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he\\r\\nbelonged.  They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common;\\r\\nand though Wickham had been little there since the death of\\r\\nDarcy\\'s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher\\r\\nintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of\\r\\nprocuring.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberly, and known the late Mr. Darcy\\r\\nby character perfectly well.  Here consequently was an\\r\\ninexhaustible subject of discourse.  In comparing her recollection\\r\\nof Pemberly with the minute description which Wickham could\\r\\ngive, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of\\r\\nits late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.  On\\r\\nbeing made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\\'s treatment\\r\\nof him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman\\'s reputed\\r\\ndisposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was\\r\\nconfident at last that she recollected having heard Mr.\\r\\nFitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured\\r\\nboy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 26\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner\\'s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly\\r\\ngiven on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her\\r\\nalone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\\r\\nyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of\\r\\nspeaking openly.  Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.\\r\\nDo not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an\\r\\naffection which the want of fortune would make so very\\r\\nimprudent.  I have nothing to say against HIM; he is a most\\r\\ninteresting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to\\r\\nhave, I should think you could not do better.  But as it is, you\\r\\nmust not let your fancy run away with you.  You have sense, and\\r\\nwe all expect you to use it.  Your father would depend on\\r\\nYOUR resolution and good conduct, I am sure.  You must not\\r\\ndisappoint your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.  I will take care of\\r\\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too.  He shall not be in love with\\r\\nme, if I can prevent it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, I will try again.  At present I am not in love\\r\\nwith Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.  But he is, beyond all\\r\\ncomparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw-- and if he\\r\\nbecomes really attached to me-- I believe it will be better that he\\r\\nshould not.  I see the imprudence of it.  Oh! THAT abominable\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  My father\\'s opinion of me does me the greatest\\r\\nhonour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it.  My father,\\r\\nhowever, is partial to Mr. Wickham.  In short, my dear aunt, I\\r\\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you\\r\\nunhappy; but since we see every day that where there is\\r\\naffection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want\\r\\nof fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how\\r\\ncan I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if\\r\\nI am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be\\r\\nwisdom  to resist?  All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\\r\\nto be in a hurry.  I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first\\r\\nobject.  When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.\\r\\nIn short, I will do my best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so\\r\\nvery often.  At least, you should not REMIND you mother of\\r\\ninviting him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:\\r\\n\"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT.  But do\\r\\nnot imagine that he is always here so often.  It is on your\\r\\naccount that he has been so frequently invited this week.  You\\r\\nknow my mother\\'s ideas as to the necessity of constant company\\r\\nfor her friends.  But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do\\r\\nwhat I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked\\r\\nher for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful\\r\\ninstance of advice being given on such a point, without being\\r\\nresented.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been\\r\\nquitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode\\r\\nwith the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.\\r\\nBennet.  His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at\\r\\nlength so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even\\r\\nrepeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she \"WISHED they\\r\\nmight be happy.\"  Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on\\r\\nWednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she\\r\\nrose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\\'s\\r\\nungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected\\r\\nherself, accompanied her out of the room.  As they went\\r\\ndownstairs together, Charlotte said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT you certainly shall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I have another favour to ask you.  Will you come and see\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.  Promise me,\\r\\ntherefore, to come to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in\\r\\nthe visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March,\" added\\r\\nCharlotte, \"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.\\r\\nIndeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding took place:  the bride and bridegroom set off for\\r\\nKent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say,\\r\\nor to hear, on the subject as usual.  Elizabeth soon heard from\\r\\nher friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent\\r\\nas it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was\\r\\nimpossible.  Elizabeth could never address her without feeling\\r\\nthat all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined\\r\\nnot to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what\\r\\nhad been, rather than what was.  Charlotte\\'s first letters were\\r\\nreceived with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\r\\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how\\r\\nshe would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare\\r\\npronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read,\\r\\nElizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point\\r\\nexactly as she might have foreseen.  She wrote cheerfully,\\r\\nseemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which\\r\\nshe could not praise.  The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\\r\\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\\'s behaviour was\\r\\nmost friendly and obliging.  It was Mr. Collins\\'s picture of\\r\\nHunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth\\r\\nperceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the\\r\\nrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce\\r\\ntheir safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth\\r\\nhoped it would be in her power to say something of the\\r\\nBingleys.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as\\r\\nimpatience generally is.  Jane had been a week in town without\\r\\neither seeing or hearing from Caroline.  She accounted for it,\\r\\nhowever, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from\\r\\nLongbourn had by some accident been lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of\\r\\nthe town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss\\r\\nBingley.  \"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words,\\r\\n\"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving\\r\\nher no notice of my coming to London.  I was right, therefore,\\r\\nmy last letter had never reached her.  I inquired after their\\r\\nbrother, of course.  He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.\\r\\nDarcy that they scarcely ever saw him.  I found that Miss Darcy\\r\\nwas expected to dinner.  I wish I could see her.  My visit was\\r\\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.  I dare say\\r\\nI shall see them soon here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter.  It convinced her that\\r\\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\\'s being in\\r\\ntown.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.  She\\r\\nendeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but\\r\\nshe could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\\'s inattention.  After\\r\\nwaiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing\\r\\nevery evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last\\r\\nappear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration\\r\\nof her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.\\r\\nThe letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\\r\\nprove what she felt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\\r\\nher better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to\\r\\nhave been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\\'s regard for me.\\r\\nBut, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do\\r\\nnot think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her\\r\\nbehaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.\\r\\nI do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate\\r\\nwith me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I\\r\\nam sure I should be deceived again.  Caroline did not return my\\r\\nvisit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the\\r\\nmeantime.  When she did come, it was very evident that she had\\r\\nno pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\r\\ncalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and\\r\\nwas in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went\\r\\naway I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no\\r\\nlonger.  I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.  She was very\\r\\nwrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every\\r\\nadvance to intimacy began on her side.  But I pity her, because\\r\\nshe must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am\\r\\nvery sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.  I need\\r\\nnot explain myself farther; and though WE know this anxiety to\\r\\nbe quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her\\r\\nbehaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister,\\r\\nwhatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\\r\\namiable.  I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such\\r\\nfears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must\\r\\nhave met, long ago.  He knows of my being in town, I am\\r\\ncertain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem,\\r\\nby her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself\\r\\nthat he is really partial to Miss Darcy.  I cannot understand it.  If\\r\\nI were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted\\r\\nto say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.\\r\\nBut I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think\\r\\nonly of what will make me happy-- your affection, and the\\r\\ninvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.  Let me hear from\\r\\nyou very soon.  Miss Bingley said something of his never\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\\r\\nwith any certainty.  We had better not mention it.  I am\\r\\nextremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our\\r\\nfriends at Hunsford.  Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\\r\\nMaria.  I am sure you will be very comfortable there.-- Yours,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as\\r\\nshe considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister\\r\\nat least.  All expectation from the brother was now absolutely\\r\\nover.  She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.\\r\\nHis character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for\\r\\nhim, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped\\r\\nhe might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\\'s sister, as by Wickham\\'s\\r\\naccount, she would make him abundantly regret what he had\\r\\nthrown away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\r\\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and\\r\\nElizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to\\r\\nher aunt than to herself.  His apparent partiality had subsided, his\\r\\nattentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.\\r\\nElizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it\\r\\nand write of it without material pain.  Her heart had been but\\r\\nslightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that\\r\\nSHE would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.\\r\\nThe sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the\\r\\nmost remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now\\r\\nrendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted\\r\\nperhaps in this case than in Charlotte\\'s, did not quarrel with him\\r\\nfor his wish of independence.  Nothing, on the contrary, could\\r\\nbe more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few\\r\\nstruggle to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and\\r\\ndesirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him\\r\\nhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating\\r\\nthe circumstances, she thus went on:-- \"I am now convinced, my\\r\\ndear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really\\r\\nexperiences that pure and elevating passion, I should at present\\r\\ndetest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.  But my\\r\\nfeelings are not only cordial towards HIM; they are even\\r\\nimpartial towards Miss King.  I cannot find out that I hate her at\\r\\nall, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good\\r\\nsort of girl.  There can be no love in all this.  My watchfulness\\r\\nhas been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\r\\ninteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in\\r\\nlove with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative\\r\\ninsignificance.  Importance may sometimes be purchased too\\r\\ndearly.  Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart\\r\\nthan I do.  They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet\\r\\nopen to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men\\r\\nmust have something to live on as well as the plain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 27\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and\\r\\notherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,\\r\\nsometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February\\r\\npass away.  March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.  She had\\r\\nnot at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte,\\r\\nshe soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually\\r\\nlearned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as\\r\\ngreater certainty.  Absence had increased her desire of seeing\\r\\nCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.  There\\r\\nwas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\r\\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little\\r\\nchange was not unwelcome for its own sake.  The journey\\r\\nwould moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the\\r\\ntime drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.\\r\\nEverything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled\\r\\naccording to Charlotte\\'s first sketch.  She was to accompany Sir\\r\\nWilliam and his second daughter.  The improvement of spending\\r\\na night in London was added in time, and the plan became\\r\\nperfect as plan could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly\\r\\nmiss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her\\r\\ngoing, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to\\r\\nanswer her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly\\r\\nfriendly; on his side even more.  His present pursuit could not\\r\\nmake him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to\\r\\ndeserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be\\r\\nadmired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her\\r\\nevery enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--\\r\\ntheir opinion of everybody-- would always coincide, there was a\\r\\nsolicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him\\r\\nwith a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced\\r\\nthat, whether married or single, he must always be her model of\\r\\nthe amiable and pleasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\r\\nthink him less agreeable.  Sir William Lucas, and his daughter\\r\\nMaria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself,\\r\\nhad nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were\\r\\nlistened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.\\r\\nElizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William\\'s too\\r\\nlong.  He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his\\r\\npresentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out,\\r\\nlike his information.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so\\r\\nearly as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.  As they drove to\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window\\r\\nwatching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was\\r\\nthere to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her\\r\\nface, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.  On the\\r\\nstairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for\\r\\ntheir cousin\\'s appearance would not allow them to wait in the\\r\\ndrawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for\\r\\na twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.  All was joy and\\r\\nkindness.  The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in\\r\\nbustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.  Their first object was\\r\\nher sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in\\r\\nreply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled\\r\\nto support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.  It was\\r\\nreasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley\\'s\\r\\nvisit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations\\r\\noccurring at different times between Jane and herself, which\\r\\nproved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\\r\\nacquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on  Wickham\\'s desertion,\\r\\nand complimented her on bearing it so well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss\\r\\nKing?  I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial\\r\\naffairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?  Where\\r\\ndoes discretion end, and avarice begin?  Last Christmas you\\r\\nwere afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent;\\r\\nand now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten\\r\\nthousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall\\r\\nknow what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.  I know no harm of\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\\'s\\r\\ndeath made her mistress of this fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- what should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain\\r\\nMY affections because I had no money, what occasion could\\r\\nthere be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about,\\r\\nand who was equally poor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions\\r\\ntowards her so soon after this event.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those\\r\\nelegant decorums which other people may observe.  If SHE does\\r\\nnot object to it, why should WE?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HER not objecting does not justify HIM.  It only shows her\\r\\nbeing deficient in something herself-- sense or feeling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose.  HE shall be\\r\\nmercenary, and SHE shall be foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do NOT choose.  I should be sorry,\\r\\nyou know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in\\r\\nDerbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who\\r\\nlive in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in\\r\\nHertfordshire are not much better.  I am sick of them all.  Thank\\r\\nHeaven!  I am going tomorrow where I shall find a man who has\\r\\nnot one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to\\r\\nrecommend him.  Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing,\\r\\nafter all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of\\r\\ndisappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she\\r\\nhad the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her\\r\\nuncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking\\r\\nin the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, \"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and\\r\\nher acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear, dear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what delight!\\r\\nwhat felicity!  You give me fresh life and vigour.  Adieu to\\r\\ndisappointment and spleen.  What are young men to rocks and\\r\\nmountains?  Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend!  And\\r\\nwhen we DO return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\\r\\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of anything.  We WILL\\r\\nknow where we have gone-- we WILL recollect what we have\\r\\nseen.  Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together\\r\\nin our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any\\r\\nparticular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative\\r\\nsituation.  Let OUR first effusions be less insupportable than\\r\\nthose of the generality of travellers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 28\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery object in the next day\\'s journey was new and interesting\\r\\nto Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she\\r\\nhad seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her\\r\\nhealth, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant\\r\\nsource of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye\\r\\nwas in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to\\r\\nbring it in view.  The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary\\r\\non one side.  Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she\\r\\nhad heard of its inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible.  The garden sloping to\\r\\nthe road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel\\r\\nhedge, everything declared they were arriving.  Mr. Collins and\\r\\nCharlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the\\r\\nsmall gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst\\r\\nthe nods and smiles of the whole party.  In a moment they were\\r\\nall out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.  Mrs.\\r\\nCollins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and\\r\\nElizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she\\r\\nfound herself so affectionately received.  She saw instantly that\\r\\nher cousin\\'s manner were not altered by his marriage; his formal\\r\\ncivility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\r\\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all\\r\\nher family.  They were then, with no other delay than his\\r\\npointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house;\\r\\nand as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a\\r\\nsecond time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode,\\r\\nand punctually repeated all his wife\\'s offers of refreshment.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not\\r\\nhelp in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the\\r\\nroom, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself\\r\\nparticularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had\\r\\nlost in refusing him.  But though everything seemed neat and\\r\\ncomfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of\\r\\nrepentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she\\r\\ncould have so cheerful an air with such a companion.  When\\r\\nMr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\r\\nashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily\\r\\nturned her eye on Charlotte.  Once of twice she could discern a\\r\\nfaint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.  After\\r\\nsitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the\\r\\nroom, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of\\r\\ntheir journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.\\r\\nCollins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was\\r\\nlarge and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he\\r\\nattended himself.  To work in this garden was one of his most\\r\\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of\\r\\ncountenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of\\r\\nthe exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.\\r\\nHere, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and\\r\\nscarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked\\r\\nfor, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left\\r\\nbeauty entirely behind.  He could number the fields in every\\r\\ndirection, and could tell how many tress there were in the most\\r\\ndistant clump.  But of all the views which his garden, or which\\r\\nthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared\\r\\nwith the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees\\r\\nthat bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.  It\\r\\nwas a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two\\r\\nmeadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the\\r\\nremains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William\\r\\naccompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the\\r\\nhouse, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity\\r\\nof showing it without her husband\\'s help.  It was rather small,\\r\\nbut well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and\\r\\narranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth\\r\\ngave Charlotte all the credit.  When Mr. Collins could be\\r\\nforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout,\\r\\nand by Charlotte\\'s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed\\r\\nhe must be often forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the\\r\\ncountry.  It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when\\r\\nMr. Collins joining in, observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I\\r\\nneed not say you will be delighted with her.  She is all affability\\r\\nand condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured\\r\\nwith some portion of her notice when service is over.  I have\\r\\nscarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my\\r\\nsister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during\\r\\nyour stay here.  Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.\\r\\nWe dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\\r\\nwalk home.  Her ladyship\\'s carriage is regularly ordered for us.\\r\\nI SHOULD say, one of her ladyship\\'s carriages, for she has\\r\\nseveral.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\\r\\nadded Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.  She is the sort of\\r\\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening was  spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire\\r\\nnews, and telling again what had already been written; and when\\r\\nit closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to\\r\\nmeditate upon Charlotte\\'s degree of contentment, to understand\\r\\nher address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her\\r\\nhusband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.  She\\r\\nhad also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor\\r\\nof their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.  A\\r\\nlively imagination soon settled it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting\\r\\nready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the\\r\\nwhole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she\\r\\nheard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling\\r\\nloudly after her.  She opened the door and met Maria in the\\r\\nlanding place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the\\r\\ndining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!  I will not tell\\r\\nyou what it is.  Make haste, and come down this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing\\r\\nmore, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted\\r\\nthe lane, in quest of this wonder!  It was two ladies stopping in a\\r\\nlow phaeton at the garden gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I expected at least that the\\r\\npigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady\\r\\nCatherine and her daughter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is\\r\\nnot Lady Catherine.  The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives\\r\\nwith them; the other is Miss de Bourgh.  Only look at her.  She\\r\\nis quite a little creature.  Who would have thought that she could\\r\\nbe so thin and small?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this\\r\\nwind.  Why does she not come in?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.  It is the greatest of\\r\\nfavours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.\\r\\n\"She looks sickly and cross.  Yes, she will do for him very well.\\r\\nShe will make him a very proper wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\\r\\nconversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\\'s high\\r\\ndiversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest\\r\\ncontemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly\\r\\nbowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,\\r\\nand the others returned into the house.  Mr. Collins no sooner\\r\\nsaw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their\\r\\ngood fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know\\r\\nthat the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 29\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was\\r\\ncomplete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness\\r\\nto his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility\\r\\ntowards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished\\r\\nfor; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon,\\r\\nwas such an instance of Lady Catherine\\'s condescension, as he\\r\\nknew not how to admire enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised\\r\\nby her ladyship\\'s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the\\r\\nevening at Rosings.  I rather expected, from my knowledge of\\r\\nher affability, that it would happen.  But who could have\\r\\nforeseen such an attention as this?  Who could have imagined\\r\\nthat we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation,\\r\\nmoreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your\\r\\narrival!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir\\r\\nWilliam, \"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great\\r\\nreally are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\\r\\nAbout the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not\\r\\nuncommon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning\\r\\nbut their visit to Rosings.  Mr. Collins was carefully instructing\\r\\nthem in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,\\r\\nso many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly\\r\\noverpower them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette. Her said to\\r\\nElizabeth--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your\\r\\napparel.  Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of\\r\\ndress in us which becomes herself and her daughter.  I would\\r\\nadvise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior\\r\\nto the rest-- there is no occasion for anything more.  Lady\\r\\nCatherine will not think the worse of you for being simply\\r\\ndressed.  She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their\\r\\ndifferent doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\\r\\nSuch formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of\\r\\nliving, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to\\r\\ncompany, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings\\r\\nwith as much apprehension as her father had done to his\\r\\npresentation at St. James\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\r\\nmile across the park.  Every park has its beauty and its\\r\\nprospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though\\r\\nshe could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the\\r\\nscene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration\\r\\nof the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the\\r\\nglazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\\'s alarm was\\r\\nevery moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look\\r\\nperfectly calm.  Elizabeth\\'s courage did not fail her.  She had\\r\\nheard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any\\r\\nextraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere\\r\\nstateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness\\r\\nwithout trepidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\r\\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,\\r\\nthey followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room\\r\\nwhere Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were\\r\\nsitting.  Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive\\r\\nthem; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the\\r\\noffice of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a\\r\\nproper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which\\r\\nhe would have thought necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of having been at St. James\\'s Sir William was so\\r\\ncompletely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had\\r\\nbut just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his\\r\\nseat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost\\r\\nout of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing\\r\\nwhich way to look.  Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the\\r\\nscene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.\\r\\nLady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\\r\\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome.  Her air was\\r\\nnot conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as\\r\\nto make her visitors forget their inferior rank.  She was not\\r\\nrendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was\\r\\nspoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance,\\r\\nand brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and\\r\\nfrom the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady\\r\\nCatherine to be exactly what he represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and\\r\\ndeportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nshe turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have\\r\\njoined in Maria\\'s astonishment at her being so thin and so small.\\r\\nThere was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the\\r\\nladies.  Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though\\r\\nnot plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in\\r\\na low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was\\r\\nnothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to\\r\\nwhat she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\\r\\nher eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the\\r\\nwindows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to\\r\\npoint out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them\\r\\nthat it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the\\r\\nservants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had\\r\\npromised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at\\r\\nthe bottom of the table, by her ladyship\\'s desire, and looked as if\\r\\nhe felt that life could furnish nothing greater.  He carved, and\\r\\nate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was\\r\\ncommended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\\r\\nenough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\\r\\nmanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\\r\\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive\\r\\nadmiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any\\r\\ndish on the table proved a novelty to them.  The party did not\\r\\nsupply much conversation.  Elizabeth was ready to speak\\r\\nwhenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\\r\\nCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh-- the former of whom was\\r\\nengaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a\\r\\nword to her all dinner-time.  Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly\\r\\nemployed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing\\r\\nher to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.\\r\\nMaria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen\\r\\ndid nothing but eat and admire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little\\r\\nto be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did\\r\\nwithout any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her\\r\\nopinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that\\r\\nshe was not used to have her judgement controverted.  She\\r\\ninquired into Charlotte\\'s domestic concerns familiarly and\\r\\nminutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management\\r\\nof them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so\\r\\nsmall a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her\\r\\ncows and her poultry.  Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath\\r\\nthis great lady\\'s attention, which could furnish her with an\\r\\noccasion of dictating to others.  In the intervals of her discourse\\r\\nwith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria\\r\\nand Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections\\r\\nshe knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a\\r\\nvery genteel, pretty kind of girl.  She asked her, at different\\r\\ntimes, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or\\r\\nyounger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be\\r\\nmarried, whether they were handsome, where they had been\\r\\neducated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\\r\\nmother\\'s maiden name?  Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\\r\\nquestions but answered them very composedly.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nthen observed,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father\\'s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.  For\\r\\nyour sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I\\r\\nsee no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.  It was\\r\\nnot thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\\'s family.  Do you\\r\\nplay and sing, Miss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! then-- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.\\r\\nOur instrument is a capital one, probably superior to---- You\\r\\nshall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of them does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did not you all learn?  You ought all to have learned.  The\\r\\nMiss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income\\r\\nas yours.  Do you draw?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, none of you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very strange.  But I suppose you had no opportunity.\\r\\nYour mother should have taken you to town every spring for the\\r\\nbenefit of masters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates\\r\\nLondon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has your governess left you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We never had any governess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No governess!  How was that possible? Five daughters brought\\r\\nup at home without a governess!  I never heard of such a thing.\\r\\nYour mother must have been quite a slave to your education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had\\r\\nnot been the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, who taught you?  who attended to you?  Without a\\r\\ngoverness, you must have been neglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us\\r\\nas wished to learn never wanted the means.  We were always\\r\\nencouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\\r\\nThose who chose to be idle, certainly might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if\\r\\nI had known your mother, I should have advised her most\\r\\nstrenuously to engage one.  I always say that nothing is to be\\r\\ndone in education without steady and regular instruction, and\\r\\nnobody but a governess can give it.  It is wonderful how many\\r\\nfamilies I have been the means of supplying in that way.  I am\\r\\nalways glad to get a young person well placed out.  Four nieces\\r\\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my\\r\\nmeans; and it was but the other day that I recommended another\\r\\nyoung person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me,\\r\\nand the family are quite delighted with her.  Mrs. Collins, did I\\r\\ntell you of Lady Metcalf\\'s calling yesterday to thank me?  She\\r\\nfinds Miss Pope a treasure.  \\'Lady Catherine,\\' said she, \\'you\\r\\nhave given me a treasure.\\'  Are any of your younger sisters out,\\r\\nMiss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All!  What, all five out at once?  Very odd!  And you only the\\r\\nsecond.  The younger ones out before the elder ones are\\r\\nmarried!  Your younger sisters must be very young?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.  Perhaps SHE is full young to\\r\\nbe much in company.  But really, ma\\'am, I think it would be\\r\\nvery hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their\\r\\nshare of society and amusement, because the elder may not have\\r\\nthe means or inclination to marry early.  The last-born has as\\r\\ngood a right to the pleasures of youth at the first.  And to be\\r\\nkept back on SUCH a motive!  I think it would not be very likely\\r\\nto promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very\\r\\ndecidedly for so young a person.  Pray, what is your age?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nsmiling, \"your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct\\r\\nanswer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature\\r\\nwho had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified\\r\\nimpertinence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need\\r\\nnot conceal your age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the\\r\\ncard-tables were placed.  Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nchose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of\\r\\nassisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party.  Their table was\\r\\nsuperlatively stupid.  Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not\\r\\nrelate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her\\r\\nfears of Miss de Bourgh\\'s being too hot or too cold, or having\\r\\ntoo much or too little light.  A great deal more passed at the\\r\\nother table.  Lady Catherine was generally speaking-- stating the\\r\\nmistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of\\r\\nherself.  Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her\\r\\nladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and\\r\\napologising if he thought he won too many.  Sir William did not\\r\\nsay much.  He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble\\r\\nnames.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as\\r\\nthey chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered.\\r\\nThe party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine\\r\\ndetermine what weather they were to have on the morrow.\\r\\nFrom these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of\\r\\nthe coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s side and as many bows on Sir William\\'s they departed.\\r\\nAs soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called\\r\\non by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at\\r\\nRosings, which, for Charlotte\\'s sake, she made more favourable\\r\\nthan it really was.  But her commendation, though costing her\\r\\nsome trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was\\r\\nvery soon obliged to take her ladyship\\'s praise into his own\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 30\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was\\r\\nlong enough to convince him of his daughter\\'s being most\\r\\ncomfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and\\r\\nsuch a neighbour as were not often met with.  While Sir William\\r\\nwas with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him\\r\\nout in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went\\r\\naway, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\\r\\nElizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\r\\ncousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between\\r\\nbreakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in\\r\\nthe garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the\\r\\nwindow in his own book-room, which fronted the road.  The\\r\\nroom in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at\\r\\nfirst rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the\\r\\ndining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and\\r\\nhad a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had\\r\\nan excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would\\r\\nundoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they\\r\\nsat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the\\r\\narrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the\\r\\nlane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of\\r\\nwhat carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de\\r\\nBourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming\\r\\nto inform them of, though it happened almost every day.  She\\r\\nnot unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\\r\\nprevailed upon to get out.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to\\r\\nRosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it\\r\\nnecessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there\\r\\nmight be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not\\r\\nunderstand the sacrifice of so many hours.  Now and then they\\r\\nwere honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing\\r\\nescaped her observation that was passing in the room during\\r\\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at\\r\\ntheir work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault\\r\\nwith the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid\\r\\nin negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do\\r\\nit only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\\'s joints of\\r\\n\\r\\neat were too large for her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\r\\ncommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active\\r\\nmagistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which\\r\\nwere carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the\\r\\ncottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too\\r\\npoor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,\\r\\nsilence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and\\r\\nplenty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice\\r\\na week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being\\r\\nonly one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was\\r\\nthe counterpart of the first.  Their other engagements were few,\\r\\nas the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s reach.  This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth,\\r\\nand upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough;\\r\\nthere were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte,\\r\\nand the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\\r\\noften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and\\r\\nwhere she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady\\r\\nCatherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of\\r\\nthe park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one\\r\\nseemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed\\r\\naway.  Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was\\r\\nto bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a\\r\\ncircle must be important.  Elizabeth had heard soon after her\\r\\narrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few\\r\\nweeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances\\r\\nwhom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one\\r\\ncomparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she\\r\\nmight be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\\'s designs\\r\\non him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was\\r\\nevidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming\\r\\nwith the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the\\r\\nhighest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had\\r\\nalready been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas walking the whole morning within view of the lodges\\r\\nopening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest\\r\\n\\r\\nassurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned\\r\\ninto the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.  On the\\r\\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.\\r\\nThere were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\\r\\nMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the\\r\\nyounger son of his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of\\r\\nall the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentleman\\r\\naccompanied him.  Charlotte had seen them from her husband\\'s\\r\\nroom, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other,\\r\\ntold the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nwould never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the\\r\\ncompliment, before their approach was announced by the\\r\\ndoor-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered\\r\\nthe room.  Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about\\r\\nthirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the\\r\\ngentleman . Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look\\r\\nin Hertfordshire-- paid his compliments, with his usual reserve,\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\r\\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth\\r\\nmerely curtseyed to him without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\r\\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very\\r\\npleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight\\r\\nobservation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for\\r\\nsome time without speaking to anybody.  At length, however,\\r\\nhis civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after\\r\\nthe health of her family.  She answered him in the usual way,\\r\\nand after a moment\\'s pause, added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.  Have\\r\\nyou never happened to see her there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to\\r\\nsee whether he would betray any consciousness of what had\\r\\npassed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he\\r\\nlooked a little confused as he answered that he had never been\\r\\nso fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.  The subject was pursued\\r\\nno farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 31\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners were very much admired at the\\r\\nParsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably\\r\\nto the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.  It was some\\r\\ndays, however, before they received any invitation thither-- for\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile there were visitors in the house, they could not be\\r\\nnecessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the\\r\\ngentlemen\\'s arrival, that they were honoured by such an\\r\\nattention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\r\\ncome there in the evening.  For the last week they had seen very\\r\\nlittle of Lady Catherine or her daughter.  Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\r\\ncalled at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.\\r\\nDarcy they had seen only at church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they\\r\\njoined the party in Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-room.  Her ladyship\\r\\nreceived them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by\\r\\nno means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and\\r\\nshe was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to\\r\\nthem, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person\\r\\nin the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything\\r\\nwas a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\\'s\\r\\npretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.  He now\\r\\nseated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and\\r\\nHertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books\\r\\nand music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained\\r\\nin that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and\\r\\nflow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well\\r\\nas of Mr. Darcy.  HIS eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\r\\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,\\r\\nafter a while, shared the feeling, was more openly\\r\\nacknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?  What is it you are\\r\\ntalking of?  What are you telling Miss Bennet?  Let me hear\\r\\nwhat it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are speaking of music, madam,\" said he, when no longer\\r\\nable to avoid a reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of music!  Then pray speak aloud.  It is of all subjects my\\r\\n\\r\\ndelight.  I must have my share in the conversation if you are\\r\\nspeaking of music.  There are few people in England, I suppose,\\r\\nwho have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better\\r\\nnatural taste.  If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great\\r\\nproficient.  And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to\\r\\napply.  I am confident that she would have performed\\r\\ndelightfully.  How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\\'s\\r\\nproficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\\r\\nCatherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to\\r\\nexcel if she does not practice a good deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such\\r\\nadvice.  She practises very constantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  It cannot be done too much; and when I\\r\\nnext write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any\\r\\naccount.  I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is\\r\\nto be acquired without constant practice.  I have told Miss\\r\\nBennet several times, that she will never play really well unless\\r\\nshe practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument,\\r\\nshe is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to\\r\\nRosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\r\\nJenkinson\\'s room.  She would be in nobody\\'s way, you know, in\\r\\nthat part of the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\\'s ill-breeding, and\\r\\nmade no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth\\r\\nof having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to\\r\\nthe instrument.  He drew a chair near her.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nlistened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other\\r\\nnephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with\\r\\nhis usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so\\r\\nas to command a full view of the fair performer\\'s countenance.\\r\\nElizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient\\r\\npause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state\\r\\nto hear me?  I will not be alarmed though your sister DOES play\\r\\nso well.  There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to\\r\\n\\r\\nbe frightened at the will of others.  My courage always rises at\\r\\nevery attempt to intimidate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you\\r\\ncould not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming\\r\\nyou; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long\\r\\nenough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally\\r\\nprofessing opinions which in fact are not your own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty\\r\\nnotion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.  I am\\r\\nparticularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose\\r\\nmy real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to\\r\\npass myself off with some degree of credit.  Indeed, Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nit is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my\\r\\ndisadvantage in Hertfordshire-- and, give me leave to say, very\\r\\nimpolitic too-- for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things\\r\\nmay come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam.  \"I should like to know how he behaves\\r\\namong strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall hear then-- but prepare yourself for something very\\r\\ndreadful.  The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nyou must know, was at a ball-- and at this ball, what do you\\r\\nthink he did?  He danced only four dances, though gentlemen\\r\\nwere scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one\\r\\nyoung lady was sitting down in want of a partner.  Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nyou cannot deny the fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the\\r\\nassembly beyond my own party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.  Well,\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?  My fingers wait your\\r\\norders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I\\r\\nsought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend\\r\\nmyself to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\nstill addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.  \"Shall we ask him why a\\r\\nman of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill\\r\\nqualified to recommend himself to strangers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without\\r\\napplying to him.  It is because he will not give himself the\\r\\ntrouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in\\r\\ntheir concerns, as I often see done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument\\r\\nin the masterly manner which I see so many women\\'s do.  They\\r\\nhave not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the\\r\\nsame expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my\\r\\nown fault-- because I will not take the trouble of practising.  It is\\r\\nnot that I do not believe MY fingers as capable as any other\\r\\nwoman\\'s of superior execution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right.  You have\\r\\nemployed your time much better.  No one admitted to the\\r\\nprivilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.  We neither\\r\\nof us perform to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to\\r\\nknow what they were talking of.  Elizabeth immediately began\\r\\nplaying again.  Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening\\r\\nfor a few minutes, said to Darcy:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,\\r\\nand could have the advantage of a London master.  She has a\\r\\nvery good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to\\r\\nAnne\\'s.  Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her\\r\\nhealth allowed her to learn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other\\r\\ncould she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of\\r\\nhis behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for\\r\\nMiss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry\\r\\nHER, had she been his relation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nperformance, mixing with them many instructions on execution\\r\\nand taste.  Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of\\r\\ncivility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the\\r\\ninstrument till her ladyship\\'s carriage was ready to take them all\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 32\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to\\r\\nJane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into\\r\\nthe village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the\\r\\ncertain signal of a visitor.  As she had heard no carriage, she\\r\\nthought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that\\r\\napprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she\\r\\nmight escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened,\\r\\nand, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only,\\r\\nentered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised\\r\\nfor his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all\\r\\nthe ladies were to be within.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were\\r\\nmade, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.  It was\\r\\nabsolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this\\r\\nemergence recollecting WHEN she had seen him last in\\r\\nHertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say\\r\\non the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November,\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.\\r\\nBingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right,\\r\\nhe went but the day before.  He and his sisters were well, I hope,\\r\\nwhen you left London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a\\r\\nshort pause added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of\\r\\never returning to Netherfield again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may\\r\\nspend very little of his time there in the future.  He has many\\r\\nfriends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are\\r\\ncontinually increasing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for\\r\\nthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for\\r\\nthen we might possibly get a settled family there.  But, perhaps,\\r\\nMr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience\\r\\nof the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to\\r\\nkeep it or quit it on the same principle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up\\r\\nas soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer.  She was afraid of talking longer of\\r\\nhis friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined\\r\\nto leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very\\r\\ncomfortable house.  Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to\\r\\nit when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe she did-- and I am sure she could not have bestowed\\r\\nher kindness on a more grateful object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a\\r\\nwife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with\\r\\none of the very few sensible women who would have accepted\\r\\nhim, or have made him happy if they had.  My friend has an\\r\\nexcellent understanding-- though I am not certain that I consider\\r\\nher marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.  She\\r\\nseems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is\\r\\ncertainly a very good match for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\r\\ndistance of her own family and friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An easy distance, do you call it?  It is nearly fifty miles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road?  Little more than half a\\r\\nday\\'s journey.  Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI should never have considered the distance as one of the\\r\\nADVANTAGES of the match,\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I should never\\r\\nhave said Mrs. Collins was settled NEAR her family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.\\r\\nAnything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I\\r\\nsuppose, would appear far.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied\\r\\nshe understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane\\r\\nand Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near\\r\\nher family.  The far and the near must be relative, and depend on\\r\\nmany varying circumstances.  Where there is fortune to make the\\r\\nexpenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.\\r\\nBut that is not the case HERE.  Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a\\r\\ncomfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent\\r\\njourneys-- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself\\r\\nNEAR her family under less than HALF the present distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"YOU\\r\\ncannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.  YOU\\r\\ncannot have been always at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked surprised.  The gentleman experienced some\\r\\nchange of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper\\r\\nfrom the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the county ensued, on either\\r\\nside calm and concise-- and soon put an end to by the entrance\\r\\nof Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk.  The\\r\\ntete-a-tete surprised them.  Mr. Darcy related the mistake which\\r\\nhad occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a\\r\\nfew minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone.  \"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he\\r\\nwould never have called us in this familiar way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very\\r\\nlikely, even to Charlotte\\'s wishes, to be the case; and after\\r\\nvarious conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to\\r\\n\\r\\nproceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was\\r\\nthe more probable from the time of year.  All field sports were\\r\\nover.  Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a\\r\\nbilliard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and\\r\\nin the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk\\r\\nto it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a\\r\\ntemptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.\\r\\nThey called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\r\\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied\\r\\nby their aunt.  It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\ncame because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion\\r\\nwhich of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nreminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by\\r\\nhis evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George\\r\\nWickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was\\r\\nless captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners, she\\r\\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more\\r\\ndifficult to understand.  It could not be for society, as he\\r\\nfrequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his\\r\\nlips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity\\r\\nrather than of choice-- a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure  to\\r\\nhimself.  He seldom appeared really animated.  Mrs. Collins\\r\\nknew not what to make of him.  Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s\\r\\noccasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\\r\\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not\\r\\nhave told her; and as she would liked to have believed this\\r\\nchange the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend\\r\\nEliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out.  She\\r\\nwatched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he\\r\\ncame to Hunsford; but without much success.  He certainly\\r\\nlooked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look\\r\\nwas disputable.  It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\\r\\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and\\r\\nsometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of\\r\\nhis being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea;\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from\\r\\nthe danger of raising expectations which might only end in\\r\\ndisappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt,\\r\\nthat all her friend\\'s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose\\r\\nhim to be in her power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her\\r\\nmarrying colonel Fitzwilliam.  He was beyond comparison the\\r\\nmost pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in\\r\\nlife was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages,\\r\\nMr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his\\r\\ncousin could have none at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 33\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\r\\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.  She felt all the perverseness of\\r\\nthe mischance that should bring him where no one else was\\r\\nbrought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to\\r\\ninform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.  How it\\r\\ncould occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!  Yet it did,\\r\\nand even a third.  It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary\\r\\npenance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal\\r\\ninquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually\\r\\nthought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.  He never\\r\\nsaid a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\\r\\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\\r\\nrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--\\r\\nabout her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary\\r\\nwalks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\\'s happiness; and\\r\\nthat in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding\\r\\nthe house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into\\r\\nKent again she would be staying THERE too.  His words\\r\\nseemed to imply it.  Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his\\r\\nthoughts?  She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean\\r\\nand allusion to what might arise in that quarter.  It distressed\\r\\nher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in\\r\\nthe pales opposite the Parsonage.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was engaged one day as she walked in perusing Jane\\'s last\\r\\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane\\r\\nhad not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised\\r\\nby Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\nwas meeting her.  Putting away the letter immediately and\\r\\nforcing a smile, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I\\r\\n\\r\\ngenerally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the\\r\\nParsonage.  Are you going much farther?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the\\r\\nParsonage together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- if Darcy does not put it off again.  But I am at his\\r\\ndisposal.  He arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at\\r\\nleast pleasure in the great power of choice.  I do not know\\r\\nanybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he\\r\\nlikes than Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam.  \"But so we all do.  It is only that he has better\\r\\nmeans of having it than many others, because he is rich, and\\r\\nmany others are poor.  I speak feelingly.  A younger son, you\\r\\nknow, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little\\r\\nof either.  Now seriously, what have you ever known of\\r\\nself-denial and dependence?  When have you been prevented by\\r\\nwant of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring\\r\\nanything you had a fancy for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are home questions-- and perhaps I cannot say that I\\r\\nhave experienced many hardships of that nature.  But in matters\\r\\nof greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.  Younger\\r\\nsons cannot marry where they like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they\\r\\nvery often do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are too\\r\\nmany in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some\\r\\nattention to money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured\\r\\nat the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And\\r\\npray, what is the usual price of an earl\\'s younger son?  Unless\\r\\n\\r\\nthe elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask\\r\\nabove fifty thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.  To\\r\\ninterrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with\\r\\nwhat had passed, she soon afterwards said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for\\r\\nthe sake of  having someone at his disposal.  I wonder he does\\r\\nnot marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.  But,\\r\\nperhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is\\r\\nunder his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he\\r\\nmust divide with me.  I am joined with him in the guardianship\\r\\nof Miss Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you indeed?  And pray what sort of guardians do you\\r\\nmake?  Does your charge give you much trouble?  Young ladies\\r\\nof her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she\\r\\nhas the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the\\r\\nmanner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed\\r\\nMiss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her\\r\\nthat she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.  She\\r\\ndirectly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not be frightened.  I never heard any harm of her; and\\r\\nI dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\\r\\nShe is a very great favourite with some ladies of my\\r\\nacquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.  I think I have heard\\r\\nyou say that you know them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know them a little.  Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike\\r\\nman-- he is a great friend of Darcy\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Care of him!  Yes, I really believe Darcy DOES take care of\\r\\nhim in those points where he most wants care.  From something\\r\\nthat he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think\\r\\nBingley very much indebted to him.  But I ought to beg his\\r\\npardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the\\r\\n\\r\\nperson meant.  It was all conjecture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally\\r\\nknown, because if it were to get round to the lady\\'s family, it\\r\\nwould be an unpleasant thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to\\r\\nbe Bingley.  What he told me was merely this: that he\\r\\ncongratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the\\r\\ninconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without\\r\\nmentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected\\r\\nit to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get\\r\\ninto a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been\\r\\ntogether the whole of last summer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections\\r\\nagainst the lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling.\\r\\n\"He only told me what I have now told you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling\\r\\nwith indignation.  After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked\\r\\nher why she was so thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Your cousin\\'s conduct does not suit my feelings.  Why was he\\r\\nto be the judge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the\\r\\npropriety of his friend\\'s inclination, or why, upon his own\\r\\njudgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner\\r\\nhis friend was to be happy.  But,\" she continued, recollecting\\r\\nherself, \"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to\\r\\ncondemn him.  It is not to be supposed that there was much\\r\\n\\r\\naffection in the case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a\\r\\nlessening of the honour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer,\\r\\nand therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on\\r\\nindifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.  There, shut\\r\\ninto her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could\\r\\nthink without interruption of all that she had heard.  It was not\\r\\nto be supposed that any other people could be meant than those\\r\\nwith whom she was connected.  There could not exist in the\\r\\nworld TWO men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such\\r\\nboundless influence.  That he had been concerned in the\\r\\nmeasures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never\\r\\ndoubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the\\r\\nprincipal design and arrangement of them.  If his own vanity,\\r\\nhowever,  did not mislead him, HE was the cause, his pride and\\r\\ncaprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still\\r\\ncontinued to suffer.  He had ruined for a while every hope of\\r\\nhappiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world;\\r\\nand no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s words; and those strong objections\\r\\nprobably were, her having one uncle who was a country\\r\\nattorney, and another who was in business in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility\\r\\nof objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!-- her\\r\\nunderstanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners\\r\\ncaptivating.  Neither could anything be urged against my father,\\r\\nwho, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself need not disdain, and respectability which he will\\r\\nprobably never each.\"  When she thought of her mother, her\\r\\nconfidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any\\r\\nobjections THERE had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\r\\npride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\\r\\nthe want of importance in his friend\\'s connections, than from\\r\\ntheir want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he\\r\\nhad been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly\\r\\nby the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on\\r\\na headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening,\\r\\nthat, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined\\r\\nher not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were\\r\\nengaged to drink tea.  Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really\\r\\nunwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible\\r\\nprevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could\\r\\nnot conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\\'s being rather\\r\\ndispleased by her staying at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 34\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate\\r\\nherself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her\\r\\nemployment the examination of all the letters which Jane had\\r\\nwritten to her since her being in Kent.  They contained no actual\\r\\ncomplaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any\\r\\ncommunication of present suffering.  But in all, and in almost\\r\\nevery line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which\\r\\nhad been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding\\r\\nfrom the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\r\\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.\\r\\nElizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of\\r\\nuneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the\\r\\nfirst perusal.  Mr. Darcy\\'s shameful boast of what misery he had\\r\\nbeen able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister\\'s\\r\\nsufferings.  It was some consolation to think that his visit to\\r\\nRosings was to end on the day after the next-- and, a still\\r\\ngreater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with\\r\\nJane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\\r\\nspirits, by all that affection could do.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not think of Darcy\\'s leaving Kent without\\r\\nremembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and\\r\\nagreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound\\r\\nof the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea\\r\\nof its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before\\r\\ncalled late in the evening, and might now come to inquire\\r\\nparticularly after her.  But this idea was soon banished, and her\\r\\n\\r\\nspirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter\\r\\namazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.  In an\\r\\nhurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health,\\r\\nimputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.  She\\r\\nanswered him with cold civility.  He sat down for a few\\r\\nmoments, and then getting up, walked about the room.\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.  After a silence of\\r\\nseveral minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and\\r\\nthus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In vain I have struggled.  It will not do.  My feelings will not be\\r\\nrepressed.  You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire\\r\\nand love you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s astonishment was beyond expression.  She stared,\\r\\ncoloured, doubted, and was silent.  This he considered sufficient\\r\\nencouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long\\r\\nfelt for her, immediately followed.  He spoke well; but there\\r\\nwere feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he\\r\\nwas not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of\\r\\npride.  His sense of her inferiority-- of its being a degradation--\\r\\nof the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination,\\r\\nwere dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\\r\\nconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\\r\\nrecommend his suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible\\r\\nto the compliment of such a man\\'s affection, and though her\\r\\nintentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for\\r\\nthe pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his\\r\\nsubsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.  She\\r\\ntried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience,\\r\\nwhen he should have done.  He concluded with representing to\\r\\nher the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his\\r\\nendeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\\r\\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her\\r\\nacceptance of his hand.  As he said this, she could easily see that\\r\\nhe had no doubt of a favourable answer.  He SPOKE of\\r\\napprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real\\r\\nsecurity.  Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther,\\r\\nand, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\r\\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed,\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever unequally they may be returned.  It is natural that\\r\\nobligation should be felt, and if I could FEEL gratitude, I would\\r\\nnow thank you.  But I cannot-- I have never desired your good\\r\\nopinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.  I\\r\\n\\r\\nam sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.  It has been most\\r\\nunconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short\\r\\nduration.  The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\\r\\nthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\\r\\novercoming it after this explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his\\r\\neyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less\\r\\nresentment than surprise.  His complexion became pale with\\r\\nanger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every\\r\\nfeature.  He was struggling for the appearance of composure,\\r\\nand would not open his lips till he believed himself to have\\r\\nattained it.  The pause was to Elizabeth\\'s feelings dreadful.  At\\r\\nlength, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is the reply which I am to have the honour of\\r\\nexpecting:  I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so\\r\\nlittle ENDEAVOUR at civility, I am thus rejected.  But it is of\\r\\nsmall importance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \" why with so evident a\\r\\ndesire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that\\r\\nyou liked me against your will, against your reason, and even\\r\\nagainst your character?  Was not this some excuse for incivility,\\r\\nif I WAS uncivil?  But I have other provocations.  You know I\\r\\nhave.  Had not my feelings decided against you-- had they been\\r\\nindifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that\\r\\nany consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\\r\\nbeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a\\r\\nmost beloved sister?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but\\r\\nthe emotion was short, and he listened without attempting\\r\\nto interrupt her while she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.  No motive\\r\\ncan excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted THERE.\\r\\nYou dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal,\\r\\nif not the only means of dividing them from each other-- of\\r\\nexposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and\\r\\n\\r\\ninstability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes,\\r\\nand involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was\\r\\nlistening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any\\r\\nfeeling of remorse.  He even looked at her with a smile of\\r\\naffected incredulity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of\\r\\ndenying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend\\r\\nfrom your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.  Towards HIM I\\r\\nhave been kinder than towards myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil\\r\\nreflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to\\r\\nconciliate her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my\\r\\ndislike is founded.  Long before it had taken place my opinion of\\r\\nyou was decided.  Your character was unfolded in the recital\\r\\nwhich I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.  On this\\r\\nsubject, what can you have to say?  In what imaginary act of\\r\\nfriendship can you here defend yourself?  or under what\\r\\nmisrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman\\'s concerns,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help\\r\\nfeeling an interest in him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his\\r\\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy.  \"You\\r\\nhave reduced him to his present state of poverty-- comparative\\r\\npoverty.  You have withheld the advantages which you must\\r\\nknow to have been designed for him.  You have deprived the\\r\\nbest years of his life of that independence which was no less his\\r\\ndue than his desert.  You have done all this!  and yet you can\\r\\ntreat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room, \"Is your opinion of me!  This is the estimation in\\r\\nwhich you hold me!  I thank you for explaining it so fully.  My\\r\\nfaults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!  But\\r\\nperhaps,\" added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards\\r\\nher, \"these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your\\r\\npride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had\\r\\nlong prevented my forming any serious design.  These bitter\\r\\naccusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\\r\\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief\\r\\nof my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by\\r\\nreason, by reflection, by everything.  But disguise of every sort is\\r\\nmy abhorrence.  Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.\\r\\nThey were natural and just.  Could you expect me to rejoice in\\r\\nthe inferiority of your connections?-- to congratulate myself on\\r\\nthe hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly\\r\\nbeneath my own?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she\\r\\ntried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of\\r\\nyour declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared\\r\\nthe concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you\\r\\nbehaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible\\r\\nway that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with\\r\\nan expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.  She went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the very beginning-- from the first moment, I may almost\\r\\nsay-- of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me\\r\\nwith the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your\\r\\nselfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the\\r\\ngroundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have\\r\\nbuilt so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month\\r\\nbefore I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I\\r\\ncould ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have said quite enough, madam.  I perfectly comprehend\\r\\nyour feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own\\r\\n\\r\\nhave been.  Forgive me for having taken up so much of your\\r\\ntime, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth\\r\\nheard him the next moment open the front door and quit the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great.  She knew not\\r\\nhow to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and\\r\\ncried for half-an-hour.  Her astonishment, as she reflected on\\r\\nwhat had passed, was increased by every review of it.  That she\\r\\nshould receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!  That he\\r\\nshould have been in love with her for so many months!  So much\\r\\nin love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\\r\\nwhich had made him prevent his friend\\'s marrying her sister, and\\r\\nwhich must appear at least with equal force in his own case--\\r\\nwas almost incredible!  It was gratifying to have inspired\\r\\nunconsciously so strong an affection.  But his pride, his\\r\\nabominable pride-- his shameless avowal of what he had done\\r\\nwith respect to Jane-- his unpardonable assurance in\\r\\nacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling\\r\\nmanner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty\\r\\ntowards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the\\r\\npity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment\\r\\nexcited.  She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s carriage made her feel how unequal she was\\r\\nto encounter Charlotte\\'s observation, and hurried her away to\\r\\nher room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 35\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and\\r\\nmeditations which had at length closed her eyes.  She could not\\r\\nyet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was\\r\\nimpossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for\\r\\nemployment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge\\r\\nherself in air and exercise.  She was proceeding directly to her\\r\\nfavourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\\'s sometimes\\r\\ncoming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she\\r\\nturned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road.\\r\\nThe park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon\\r\\npassed one of the gates into the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she\\r\\nwas tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the\\r\\ngates and look into the park.  The five weeks which she had now\\r\\npassed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and\\r\\nevery day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.  She was\\r\\non the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse\\r\\nof a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he\\r\\nwas moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was\\r\\ndirectly retreating.  But the person who advanced was now near\\r\\nenough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\\r\\npronounced her name.  She had turned away; but on hearing\\r\\nherself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she moved again towards the gate.  He had by that time\\r\\nreached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively\\r\\ntook, said, with a look of haughty composure, \"I have been\\r\\nwalking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.  Will\\r\\nyou do me the honour of reading that letter?\"  And then, with a\\r\\nslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\\r\\nElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\\r\\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper,\\r\\nwritten quite through, in a very close hand.  The envelope itself\\r\\nwas likewise full.  Pursuing her way along the lane, she then\\r\\nbegan it.  It was dated from Rosings, at eight o\\'clock in the\\r\\nmorning, and was as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the\\r\\napprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments\\r\\nor renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to\\r\\nyou.  I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\\r\\nmyself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,\\r\\ncannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation\\r\\nand the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\\r\\nspared had not my character required it to be written and read.\\r\\nYou must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\\r\\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly,\\r\\nbut I demand it of your justice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of\\r\\nequal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.  The first\\r\\nmentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had\\r\\ndetached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had,\\r\\nin defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and\\r\\n\\r\\nhumanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the\\r\\nprospects of Mr. Wickham.  Wilfully and wantonly to have\\r\\nthrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\\r\\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\\r\\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought\\r\\nup to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the\\r\\nseparation of two young persons, whose affection could be the\\r\\ngrowth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.  But\\r\\nfrom the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally\\r\\nbestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the\\r\\nfuture secured, when the following account of my actions and\\r\\ntheir motives has been read.  If, in the explanation of them,\\r\\nwhich is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating\\r\\nfeelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I\\r\\nam sorry.  The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology\\r\\nwould be absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common\\r\\nwith others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other\\r\\nyoung woman in the country.  But it was not till the evening of\\r\\nthe dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his\\r\\nfeeling a serious attachment.  I had often seen him in love before.\\r\\nAt that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was\\r\\nfirst made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas\\'s accidental\\r\\ninformation, that Bingley\\'s attentions to your sister had given\\r\\nrise to a general expectation of their marriage.  He spoke of it as\\r\\na certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.\\r\\n>From that moment I observed my friend\\'s behaviour attentively;\\r\\nand I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was\\r\\nbeyond what I had ever witnessed in him.  Your sister I also\\r\\nwatched.  Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and\\r\\nengaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard,\\r\\nand I remained convinced from the evening\\'s scrutiny, that\\r\\nthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not\\r\\ninvite them by any participation of sentiment.  If YOU have not\\r\\nbeen mistaken here, I must have been in error.  Your superior\\r\\nknowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.  If it be\\r\\nso, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your\\r\\nresentment has not been unreasonable.  But I shall not scruple to\\r\\nassert, that the serenity of your sister\\'s countenance and air was\\r\\nsuch as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\\r\\nthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\\r\\neasily touched.  That I was desirous of believing her indifferent\\r\\nis certain-- but I will venture to say that my investigation and\\r\\ndecisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.  I did\\r\\n\\r\\nnot believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it\\r\\non impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.  My\\r\\nobjections to the marriage were not merely those which I last\\r\\nnight acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put\\r\\naside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so\\r\\ngreat an evil to my friend as to me.  But there were other causes\\r\\nof repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing\\r\\nto an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured\\r\\nto forget, because they were not immediately before me.  These\\r\\ncauses must be stated, though briefly.  The situation of your\\r\\nmother\\'s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\\r\\ncomparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so\\r\\nalmost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger\\r\\nsisters, and occasionally even by your father.  Pardon me.  It\\r\\npains me to offend you.  But amidst your concern for the defects\\r\\nof  your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\r\\nrepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider\\r\\nthat, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of\\r\\nthe like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and\\r\\nyour elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and\\r\\ndisposition of both.  I will only say farther that from what passed\\r\\nthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\\r\\ninducement heightened which could have led me before to\\r\\npreserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\r\\nconnection.  He left Netherfield for London, on the day\\r\\nfollowing, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of\\r\\nsoon returning.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The part which I acted is now to be explained.  His sisters\\'\\r\\nuneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\\r\\ncoincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible\\r\\nthat no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\\r\\nresolved on joining him directly in London.  We accordingly\\r\\nwent-- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out\\r\\nto my friend the certain evils of such a choice.  I described, and\\r\\nenforced them earnestly.  But, however this remonstrance might\\r\\nhave staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\\r\\nthat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not\\r\\nbeen seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of\\r\\nyour sister\\'s indifference.  He had before believed her to return\\r\\nhis affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.  But Bingley\\r\\nhas great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my\\r\\njudgement than on his own.  To convince him, therefore, that he\\r\\nhad deceived himself, was no very difficult point.  To persuade\\r\\nhim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction\\r\\n\\r\\nhad been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.  I cannot\\r\\nblame myself for having done thus much.  There is but one part\\r\\nof my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with\\r\\nsatisfaction; it is, that I condescended to adopt the measures of\\r\\nart so far as to conceal from him your sister\\'s being in town.  I\\r\\nknew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother\\r\\nis even yet ignorant of it.  That they might have met without ill\\r\\nconsequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear\\r\\nto me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\\r\\ndanger.  Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me;\\r\\nit is done, however, and it was done for the best.  On this subject\\r\\nI have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.  If I have\\r\\nwounded your sister\\'s feelings, it was unknowingly done and\\r\\nthough the motives which governed me may to you very\\r\\nnaturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having\\r\\ninjured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you\\r\\nthe whole of his connection with my family.  Of what he has\\r\\nPARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of\\r\\nwhat I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of\\r\\nundoubted veracity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for\\r\\nmany years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and\\r\\nwhose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally\\r\\ninclined my father to be of service to him; and on George\\r\\nWickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore\\r\\nliberally bestowed.  My father supported him at school, and\\r\\nafterwards at Cambridge-- most important assistance, as his own\\r\\nfather, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would\\r\\nhave been unable to give him a gentleman\\'s education.  My\\r\\nfather was not only fond of this young man\\'s society, whose\\r\\nmanner were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of\\r\\nhim, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to\\r\\nprovide for him in it.  As for myself, it is many, many years since\\r\\nI first began to think of him in a very different manner.  The\\r\\nvicious propensities-- the want of principle, which he was careful\\r\\nto guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\\r\\nthe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with\\r\\nhimself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded\\r\\nmoments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.  Here again shall\\r\\ngive you pain-- to what degree you only can tell.  But whatever\\r\\nmay be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\\r\\n\\r\\nsuspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\\r\\nreal character-- it adds even another motive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his\\r\\nattachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his\\r\\nwill he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his\\r\\nadvancement in the best manner that his profession might\\r\\nallow--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\\r\\nmight be his as soon as it became vacant.  There was also a\\r\\nlegacy of one thousand pounds.  His own father did not long\\r\\nsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.\\r\\nWickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved\\r\\nagainst taking orders, he hoped I should not think it\\r\\nunreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary\\r\\nadvantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\\r\\nbenefited.  He had some intention, he added, of studying law,\\r\\nand I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be a very insufficient support therein.  I rather wished,\\r\\nthan believed him to be sincere-- but, at any rate, was perfectly\\r\\nready to accede to his proposal.  I knew that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon\\r\\nsettled-- he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it\\r\\npossible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and\\r\\naccepted in return three thousand pounds.  All connection\\r\\nbetween us seemed now dissolved.  I thought too ill of him to\\r\\ninvite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.  In town I\\r\\nbelieve he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere\\r\\npretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life\\r\\nof idleness and dissipation.  For about three years I heard little of\\r\\nhim; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had\\r\\nbeen designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the\\r\\npresentation.  His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.  He had found\\r\\nthe law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\\r\\nresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living\\r\\nin question-- of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as\\r\\nhe was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\\r\\nand I could not have forgotten my revered father\\'s intentions.\\r\\nYou will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this\\r\\nentreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it.  His resentment\\r\\nwas in proportion to the distress of his circumstances-- and he\\r\\nwas doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his\\r\\nreproaches to myself.  After this period every appearance of\\r\\nacquaintance was dropped.  How he lived I know not.  But last\\r\\nsummer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to\\r\\nforget myself, and which no obligation less than the present\\r\\nshould induce me to unfold to any human being.  Having said\\r\\nthus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.  My sister, who is\\r\\nmore than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of\\r\\nmy mother\\'s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.  About a\\r\\nyear ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment\\r\\nformed for her in London; and last summer she went with the\\r\\nlady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went\\r\\nMr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have\\r\\nbeen a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in\\r\\nwhose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her\\r\\nconnivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to\\r\\nGeorgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression\\r\\nof his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to\\r\\nbelieve herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.  She was\\r\\nthen but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\\r\\nimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it\\r\\nto herself.  I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the\\r\\nintended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\\r\\nidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost\\r\\nlooked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.  You\\r\\nmay imagine what I felt and how I acted.  Regard for my sister\\'s\\r\\ncredit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to\\r\\nMr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge\\r\\nwas of course removed from her charge.  Mr. Wickham\\'s object\\r\\nwas unquestionably my sister\\'s fortune, which is thirty thousand\\r\\npounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\\r\\nhimself on me was a strong inducement.  His revenge would\\r\\nhave been complete indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\\r\\nhave been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\\r\\nreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of\\r\\ncruelty towards Mr. Wickham.  I know not in what manner,\\r\\nunder what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his\\r\\nsuccess is not perhaps to be wondered at, ignorant as you\\r\\npreviously were of everything concerning either.  Detection\\r\\ncould not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your\\r\\ninclination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last\\r\\nnight; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what\\r\\ncould or ought to be revealed.  For the truth of everything here\\r\\n\\r\\nrelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and\\r\\nconstant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my\\r\\nfather\\'s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every\\r\\nparticular of these transactions.  If your abhorrence of ME\\r\\nshould make MY assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented\\r\\nby the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there\\r\\nmay be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to\\r\\nfind some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\\r\\ncourse of the morning.  I will only add, God bless you,\\r\\n                                   \"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 36\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect\\r\\nit to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no\\r\\nexpectation at all of its contents.  But such as they were, it may\\r\\nwell be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what\\r\\na contrariety of emotion they excited.  Her feelings as she read\\r\\nwere scarcely to be defined.  With amazement did she first\\r\\nunderstand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and\\r\\nsteadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\r\\nto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.  With a\\r\\nstrong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his\\r\\naccount of what had happened at Netherfield.  She read with an\\r\\neagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and\\r\\nfrom impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring,\\r\\nwas incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her\\r\\neyes. His belief of her sister\\'s insensibility she instantly resolved\\r\\nto be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to\\r\\nthe match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him\\r\\njustice.  He expressed no regret for what he had done which\\r\\nsatisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.  It was all\\r\\npride and insolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\\r\\nWickham-- when she read with somewhat clearer attention a\\r\\nrelation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished\\r\\nopinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to\\r\\nhis own history of himself-- her feelings were yet more acutely\\r\\npainful and more difficult of definition.  Astonishment,\\r\\napprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.  She wished to\\r\\ndiscredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cannot be!  This must be the grossest falsehood!\"-- and\\r\\nwhen she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely\\r\\nknowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away,\\r\\nprotesting that she would not regard it, that she would never\\r\\nlook in it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\r\\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the\\r\\nletter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she\\r\\ncould, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related\\r\\nto Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the\\r\\nmeaning of every sentence.  The account of his connection with\\r\\nthe Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself;\\r\\nand the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not\\r\\nbefore known its extent, agreed equally well with his own\\r\\nwords.  So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she\\r\\ncame to the will, the difference was great.  What Wickham had\\r\\nsaid of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled\\r\\nhis very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross\\r\\nduplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she\\r\\nflattered herself that her wishes did not err.  But when she read\\r\\nand re-read with the closest attention, the particulars\\r\\nimmediately following of Wickham\\'s resigning all pretensions to\\r\\nthe living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\\r\\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.  She put\\r\\ndown the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she\\r\\nmeant to be impartiality-- deliberated on the probability of each\\r\\nstatement-- but with little success.  On both sides it was only\\r\\nassertion.  Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly\\r\\nthat the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any\\r\\ncontrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy\\'s conduct\\r\\nin it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make\\r\\nhim entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not\\r\\nto lay at Mr. Wickham\\'s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the\\r\\nmore so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.  She had\\r\\nnever heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia,\\r\\nin which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man\\r\\nwho, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a\\r\\nslight acquaintance.  Of his former way of life nothing had been\\r\\nknown in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.  As to his real\\r\\ncharacter, had information been in her power, she had never felt\\r\\na wish of inquiring.  His countenance, voice, and manner had\\r\\nestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue.  She\\r\\n\\r\\ntried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\\r\\ntrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\\r\\nattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue,\\r\\natone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour\\r\\nto class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of\\r\\nmany years\\' continuance.  But no such recollection befriended\\r\\nher.  She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of\\r\\nair and address; but she could remember no more substantial\\r\\ngood than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\\r\\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.\\r\\nAfter pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more\\r\\ncontinued to read.  But, alas! the story which followed, of his\\r\\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what\\r\\nhad passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the\\r\\nmorning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of\\r\\nevery particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself-- from whom she\\r\\nhad previously received the information of his near concern in all\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to\\r\\nquestion.  At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\\r\\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the\\r\\napplication, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\\r\\nMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had\\r\\nnot been well assured of his cousin\\'s corroboration.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in\\r\\nconversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening\\r\\nat Mr. Phillips\\'s.  Many of his expressions were still fresh in her\\r\\nmemory.  She was NOW struck with the impropriety of such\\r\\ncommunications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her\\r\\nbefore.  She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he\\r\\nhad done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his\\r\\nconduct.  She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\\r\\nof seeing Mr. Darcy-- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country,\\r\\nbut that HE should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the\\r\\nNetherfield ball the very next week.  She remembered also that,\\r\\ntill the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his\\r\\nstory to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had\\r\\nbeen everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no\\r\\nscruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\\'s character, though he had assured\\r\\nher that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing\\r\\nthe son.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was\\r\\nconcerned!  His attentions to Miss King were now the\\r\\nconsequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the\\r\\n\\r\\nmediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his\\r\\nwishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.  His behaviour to\\r\\nherself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either\\r\\nbeen deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\\r\\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she\\r\\nhad most incautiously shown.  Every lingering struggle in his\\r\\nfavour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she could not but allow Mr. Bingley, when questioned by\\r\\nJane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that\\r\\nproud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the\\r\\nwhole course of their acquaintance-- an acquaintance which\\r\\nhad latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of\\r\\nintimacy with his ways-- seen anything that betrayed him to be\\r\\nunprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or\\r\\nimmoral habits; that among his own connections he was\\r\\nesteemed and valued-- that even Wickham had allowed him\\r\\nmerit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so\\r\\naffectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some\\r\\namiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham\\r\\nrepresented them, so gross a violation of everything right could\\r\\nhardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship\\r\\nbetween a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as\\r\\nBingley, was incomprehensible.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself.  Of neither Darcy nor\\r\\nWickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,\\r\\npartial, prejudiced, absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How despicably I have acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have prided\\r\\nmyself on my discernment!  I, who have valued myself on my\\r\\nabilities!  who have often disdained the generous candour of my\\r\\nsister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!\\r\\nHow humiliating is this discovery!  yet, how just a humiliation!\\r\\nHad I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!\\r\\nBut vanity, not love, has been my folly.  Pleased with the\\r\\npreference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on\\r\\nthe very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\r\\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where\\r\\neither were concerned.  Till this moment I never knew myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n>From herself to Jane-- from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were\\r\\nin a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nexplanation THERE had appeared very insufficient, and she read\\r\\nit again.  Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.\\r\\nHow could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich she had been obliged to give in the other?  He declared\\r\\nhimself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister\\'s attachment; and\\r\\nshe could not help remembering what Charlotte\\'s opinion had\\r\\nalways been.  Neither could she deny the justice of his\\r\\ndescription of Jane.  She felt that Jane\\'s feelings, though fervent,\\r\\nwere little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency\\r\\nin her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\r\\nmentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her\\r\\nsense of shame was severe.  The justice of the charge struck her\\r\\ntoo forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he\\r\\nparticularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and\\r\\nas confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a\\r\\nstronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.  It\\r\\nsoothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had\\r\\nthus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she\\r\\nconsidered that Jane\\'s disappointment had in fact been the work\\r\\nof her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit\\r\\nof both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt\\r\\ndepressed beyond anything she had ever known before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to\\r\\nevery variety of thought--re-considering events, determining\\r\\nprobabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a\\r\\nchange so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection\\r\\nof her long absence, made her at length return home; and she\\r\\nentered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,\\r\\nand the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make\\r\\nher unfit for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings\\r\\nhad each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few\\r\\nminutes, to take leave-- but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been\\r\\nsitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and\\r\\nalmost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.\\r\\nElizabeth could but just AFFECT concern in missing him; she\\r\\nreally rejoiced at it.  Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an\\r\\nobject; she could think only of her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 37\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr.\\r\\nCollins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his\\r\\nparting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing\\r\\nintelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as\\r\\ntolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene\\r\\nso lately gone through at Rosings.  To Rosings he then hastened,\\r\\nto console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\\r\\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her\\r\\nladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her\\r\\nvery desirous of having them all to dine with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,\\r\\nhad she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to\\r\\nher as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of\\r\\nwhat her ladyship\\'s indignation would have been.  \"What would\\r\\nshe have said? how would she have behaved?\" were questions\\r\\nwith which she amused herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.  \"I\\r\\nassure you, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I believe\\r\\nno one feels the loss of friends so much as I do.  But I am\\r\\nparticularly attached to these young men, and know them to be\\r\\nso much attached to me!  They were excessively sorry to go!\\r\\nBut so they always are.  The dear Colonel rallied his spirits\\r\\ntolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,\\r\\nmore, I think, than last year.  His attachment to Rosings\\r\\ncertainly increases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,\\r\\nwhich were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed\\r\\nout of spirits. And immediately accounting for it by herself, by\\r\\nsupposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg\\r\\nthat you may stay a little longer.  Mrs. Collins will be very glad\\r\\nof your company, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\"\\r\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to accept it.  I must\\r\\nbe in town next Saturday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.  I\\r\\nexpected you to stay two months.  I told Mrs. Collins so before\\r\\nyou came.  There can be no occasion for your going so soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my father cannot.  He wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.\\r\\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father.  And if\\r\\nyou will stay another MONTH complete, it will be in my power\\r\\nto take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in\\r\\nJune, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the\\r\\nbarouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--\\r\\nand indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not\\r\\nobject to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by\\r\\nour original plan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned.  \"Mrs. Collins, you must send\\r\\na servant with them.  You know I always speak my mind, and I\\r\\ncannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by\\r\\nthemselves.  It is highly improper.  You must contrive to send\\r\\nsomebody.  I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of\\r\\nthing.  Young women should always be properly guarded and\\r\\nattended, according to their situation in life.  When my niece\\r\\nGeorgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\\r\\nhaving two men-servants go with her.  Miss Darcy, the daughter\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have\\r\\nappeared with propriety in a different manner.  I am excessively\\r\\nattentive to all those things.  You must send John with the young\\r\\nladies, Mrs. Collins.  I am glad it occurred to me to mention it;\\r\\nfor it would really be discreditable to YOU to let them go\\r\\nalone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Your uncle!  He keeps a man-servant, does he?  I am very\\r\\nglad you have somebody who thinks of these things.  Where\\r\\nshall you change horses?  Oh!  Bromley, of course.  If you\\r\\nmention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their\\r\\njourney, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was\\r\\nnecessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with\\r\\n\\r\\na mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nReflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she\\r\\nwas alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day\\r\\nwent by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all\\r\\nthe delight of unpleasant recollections.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by\\r\\nheart.  She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its\\r\\nwriter were at times widely different.  When she remembered the\\r\\nstyle of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she\\r\\nconsidered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,\\r\\nher anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed\\r\\nfeelings became the object of compassion.  His attachment\\r\\nexcited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could\\r\\nnot approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,\\r\\nor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.  In her\\r\\nown past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation\\r\\nand regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a constant\\r\\nsource of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her\\r\\nfamily, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.  They were hopeless of\\r\\nremedy.  Her father, contented with laughing at them, would\\r\\nnever exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest\\r\\ndaughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\\r\\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil.  Elizabeth had\\r\\nfrequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the\\r\\nimprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were\\r\\nsupported by their mother\\'s indulgence, what chance could there\\r\\nbe of improvement?  Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and\\r\\ncompletely under Lydia\\'s guidance, had been always affronted\\r\\nby their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\\r\\nscarcely give them a hearing.  They were ignorant, idle, and vain.\\r\\nWhile there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him;\\r\\nand while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would\\r\\nbe going there forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnxiety on Jane\\'s behalf was another prevailing concern; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former\\r\\ngood opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.  His\\r\\naffection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct\\r\\ncleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness\\r\\nof his confidence in his friend.  How grievous then was the\\r\\nthought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so\\r\\nreplete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\\r\\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last\\r\\nweek of her stay as they had been at first.  The very last evening\\r\\nwas spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into\\r\\nthe particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the\\r\\nbest method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of\\r\\nplacing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself\\r\\nobliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and\\r\\npack her trunk afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,\\r\\nwished them a good journey, and invited them to come to\\r\\nHunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so\\r\\nfar as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 38\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for\\r\\nbreakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took\\r\\nthe opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed\\r\\nindispensably necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs. Collins has\\r\\nyet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I\\r\\nam very certain you will not leave the house without receiving\\r\\nher thanks for it.  The favor of your company has been much\\r\\nfelt, I assure you.  We know how little there is to tempt any one\\r\\nto our humble abode.  Our plain manner of living, our small\\r\\nrooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world,\\r\\nmust make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\\r\\nyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the\\r\\ncondescension, and that we have done everything in our power\\r\\nto prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of\\r\\nhappiness.  She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and\\r\\nthe pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she\\r\\nhad received, must make HER feel the obliged.  Mr. Collins was\\r\\ngratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your\\r\\ntime not disagreeably.  We have certainly done our best; and\\r\\nmost fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to  very\\r\\nsuperior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the\\r\\n\\r\\nfrequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we\\r\\nmay flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been\\r\\nentirely irksome.  Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nfamily is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing\\r\\nwhich few can boast.  You see on what a footing we are.  You\\r\\nsee how continually we are engaged there.  In truth I must\\r\\nacknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble\\r\\nparsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of\\r\\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he\\r\\nwas obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to\\r\\nunite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\r\\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin.  I flatter myself at least that you\\r\\nwill be able to do so. Lady Catherine\\'s great attentions to Mrs.\\r\\nCollins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it\\r\\ndoes not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate----\\r\\nBut on this point it will be as well to be silent.  Only let me\\r\\nassure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart\\r\\nmost cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.  My dear\\r\\nCharlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.\\r\\nThere is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\\r\\ncharacter and ideas between us.  We seem to have been designed\\r\\nfor each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where\\r\\nthat was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she\\r\\nfirmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.  She was\\r\\nnot sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the\\r\\nlady from whom they sprang.  Poor Charlotte!  it was\\r\\nmelancholy to leave her to such society!  But she had chosen it\\r\\nwith her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her\\r\\nvisitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.\\r\\nHer home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and\\r\\nall their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the\\r\\nparcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.  After\\r\\nan affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was\\r\\nattended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked\\r\\ndown the garden he was commissioning her with his best\\r\\nrespects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the\\r\\nkindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\\r\\n\\r\\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.  He\\r\\nthen handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the\\r\\npoint of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with\\r\\nsome consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any\\r\\nmessage for the ladies at Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your humble\\r\\nrespects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their\\r\\nkindness to you while you have been here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be\\r\\nshut, and the carriage drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes\\' silence, \"it\\r\\nseems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many\\r\\nthings have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there\\r\\ntwice!  How much I shall have to tell!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth added privately, \"And how much I shall have to\\r\\nconceal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any\\r\\nalarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they\\r\\nreached Mr. Gardiner\\'s house, where they were to remain a few\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of\\r\\nstudying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the\\r\\nkindness of her aunt had reserved for them.  But Jane was to go\\r\\nhome with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough\\r\\nfor observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait\\r\\neven for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nproposals.  To know that she had the power of revealing what\\r\\nwould so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time,\\r\\nso highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet\\r\\nbeen able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as\\r\\nnothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in\\r\\nwhich she remained as to the extent of what she should\\r\\ncommunicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of\\r\\n\\r\\nbeing hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might\\r\\nonly grieve her sister further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 39\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies\\r\\nset out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in\\r\\nHertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived,\\r\\nin token of the coachman\\'s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia\\r\\nlooking out of a dining-room upstairs.  These two girls had been\\r\\nabove an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an\\r\\nopposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a\\r\\nsalad and cucumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table\\r\\nset out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords,\\r\\nexclaiming, \"Is not this nice?  Is not this an agreeable surprise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia, \"but you must\\r\\nlend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out\\r\\nthere.\"  Then, showing her purchases-- \"Look here, I have\\r\\nbought this bonnet.  I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought\\r\\nI might as well buy it as not.  I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I\\r\\nget home, and see if I can not make it up any better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\r\\nunconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the\\r\\nshop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to\\r\\ntrim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.  Besides, it will\\r\\nnot much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire\\r\\nhave left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are they indeed!\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so\\r\\nwant papa to take us all there for the summer!  It would be such\\r\\na delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at\\r\\nall.  Mamma would like to go too of all things!  Only think what\\r\\na miserable summer else we shall have!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"THAT would be a delightful scheme\\r\\nindeed, and completely do for us at once.  Good Heaven!\\r\\nBrighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been\\r\\n\\r\\noverset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly\\r\\nballs of Meryton!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they sat\\r\\ndown at table.  \"What do you think?  It is excellent news--\\r\\ncapital news-- and about a certain person we all like!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told\\r\\nhe need not stay.  Lydia laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.  You\\r\\nthought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!  I dare say he\\r\\noften hears worse things said than I am going to say.  But he is\\r\\nan ugly fellow!  I am glad he is gone.  I never saw such a long\\r\\nchin in my life.  Well, but now for my news; it is about dear\\r\\nWickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?  There is no danger\\r\\nof Wickham\\'s marrying Mary King.  There\\'s for you!  She is\\r\\ngone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.  Wickham is\\r\\nsafe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a\\r\\nconnection imprudent as to fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said\\r\\nJane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure there is not on HIS.  I will answer for it, he never\\r\\ncared three straws about her-- who could about such a nasty\\r\\nlittle freckled thing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\r\\ncoarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of the\\r\\nSENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had\\r\\nharboured and fancied liberal!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\r\\nordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all\\r\\ntheir boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition\\r\\nof Kitty\\'s and Lydia\\'s purchases, were seated in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How nicely we are all crammed in,\" cried Lydia.  \"I am glad I\\r\\nbought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another\\r\\nbandbox!  Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and\\r\\n\\r\\ntalk and laugh all the way home.  And in the first place, let us\\r\\nhear what has happened to you all since you went away.  Have\\r\\nyou seen any pleasant men?  Have you had any flirting?  I was in\\r\\ngreat hopes that one of you would have got a husband before\\r\\nyou came back.  Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\r\\nShe is almost three-and-twenty!  My aunt Phillips wants you so\\r\\nto get husbands, you can\\'t think.  She says Lizzy had better have\\r\\ntaken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been\\r\\nany fun in it.  Lord! how I should like to be married before any\\r\\nof you!  and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\r\\nDear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at\\r\\nColonel Forster\\'s.  Kitty and me were to spend the day there,\\r\\nand Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening;\\r\\n(by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she\\r\\nasked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so\\r\\nPen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think\\r\\nwe did?  We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\\'s clothes on\\r\\npurpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!  Not a soul\\r\\nknew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me,\\r\\nexcept my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her\\r\\ngowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!  When\\r\\nDenny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the\\r\\nmen came in, they did not know him in the least.  Lord!  how I\\r\\nlaughed! and so did Mrs. Forster.  I thought I should have died.\\r\\nAnd THAT made the men suspect something, and then they\\r\\nsoon found out what was the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\r\\nLydia, assisted by Kitty\\'s hints and additions, endeavour to\\r\\namuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlistened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the\\r\\nfrequent mention of Wickham\\'s name.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception at home was most kind.  Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to\\r\\nsee Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during\\r\\ndinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the\\r\\nLucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various\\r\\nwere the subjects that occupied them:  Lady Lucas was inquiring\\r\\nof Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter;\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an\\r\\naccount of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way\\r\\n\\r\\nbelow her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger\\r\\nLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other\\r\\nperson\\'s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning\\r\\nto anybody who would hear her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had\\r\\nsuch fun!  As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and\\r\\npretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have\\r\\ngone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got\\r\\nto the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we\\r\\ntreated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the\\r\\nworld, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you\\r\\ntoo.  And then when we came away it was such fun!  I thought\\r\\nwe never should have got into the coach.  I was ready to die of\\r\\nlaughter.  And then we were so merry all the way home!  we\\r\\ntalked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us\\r\\nten miles off!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear\\r\\nsister, to depreciate such pleasures!  They would doubtless be\\r\\ncongenial with the generality of female minds.  But I confess\\r\\nthey would have no charms for ME-- I should infinitely prefer a\\r\\nbook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word.  She seldom listened\\r\\nto anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to\\r\\nMary at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to\\r\\nwalk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but\\r\\nElizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.  It should not be said\\r\\nthat the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before\\r\\nthey were in pursuit of the officers.  There was another reason\\r\\ntoo for her opposition.  She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again,\\r\\nand was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.  The comfort to\\r\\nHER of the regiment\\'s approaching removal was indeed beyond\\r\\nexpression.  In a fortnight they were to go-- and once gone, she\\r\\nhoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not been many hours at home before she found that the\\r\\nBrighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the\\r\\ninn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.\\r\\nElizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest\\r\\nintention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so\\r\\nvague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\\r\\n\\r\\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 40\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened\\r\\ncould no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to\\r\\nsuppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and\\r\\npreparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next\\r\\nmorning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet\\'s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong\\r\\nsisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear\\r\\nperfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other\\r\\nfeelings.  She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his\\r\\nsentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but\\r\\nstill more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\\'s\\r\\nrefusal must have given him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she, \"and\\r\\ncertainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it\\r\\nmust increase his disappointment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he\\r\\nhas other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his\\r\\nregard for me.  You do not blame me, however, for refusing\\r\\nhim?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Blame you!  Oh, no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you WILL know it, when I tell you what happened the very\\r\\nnext day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents\\r\\nas far as they concerned George Wickham.  What a stroke was\\r\\nthis for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the\\r\\nworld without believing that so much wickedness existed in the\\r\\nwhole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.\\r\\nNor was Darcy\\'s vindication, though grateful to her feelings,\\r\\n\\r\\ncapable of consoling her for such discovery.  Most earnestly did\\r\\nshe labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the\\r\\none without involving the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able to\\r\\nmake both of them good for anything.  Take your choice, but\\r\\nyou must be satisfied with only one.  There is but such a quantity\\r\\nof merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of\\r\\nman; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.  For my\\r\\npart, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\\'s; but you shall do as\\r\\nyou choose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted\\r\\nfrom Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Wickham so very bad!  It is almost past belief.  And poor Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.\\r\\nSuch a disappointment!  and with the knowledge of your ill\\r\\nopinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister!  It is\\r\\nreally too distressing.  I am sure you must feel it so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing\\r\\nyou so full of both.  I know you will do him such ample justice,\\r\\nthat I am growing every moment more unconcerned and\\r\\nindifferent.  Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament\\r\\nover him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\r\\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the\\r\\neducation of those two young men.  One has got all the\\r\\ngoodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the APPEARANCE\\r\\nof it as you used to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided\\r\\na dislike to him, without any reason.  It is such a spur to one\\'s\\r\\ngenius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.\\r\\nOne may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but\\r\\none cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then\\r\\nstumbling on something witty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not\\r\\ntreat the matter as you do now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, I could not.  I was uncomfortable enough, I may say\\r\\nunhappy.  And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no\\r\\nJane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and\\r\\nvain and nonsensical as I knew I had!  Oh! how I wanted you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong\\r\\nexpressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they\\r\\nDO appear wholly undeserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.  But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a\\r\\nmost natural consequence of the prejudices I had been\\r\\nencouraging.  There is one point on which I want your advice.  I\\r\\nwant to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our\\r\\nacquaintances in general understand Wickham\\'s character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there can\\r\\nbe no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.  What is your\\r\\nopinion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That it ought not to be attempted.  Mr. Darcy has not\\r\\nauthorised me to make his communication public.  On the\\r\\ncontrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be\\r\\nkept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to\\r\\nundeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe\\r\\nme?  The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that\\r\\nit would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to\\r\\nattempt to place him in an amiable light.  I am not equal to it.\\r\\nWickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\\r\\nanyone here what he really is.  Some time hence it will be all\\r\\nfound out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not\\r\\nknowing it before.  At present I will say nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right.  To have his errors made public might ruin\\r\\nhim for ever.  He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done,\\r\\nand anxious to re-establish a character.  We must not make him\\r\\ndesperate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth\\'s mind was allayed by this conversation.\\r\\nShe had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her\\r\\nfor a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,\\r\\nwhenever she might wish to talk again of either.  But there was\\r\\nstill something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the\\r\\n\\r\\ndisclosure.  She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nletter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been\\r\\nvalued by her friend.  Here was knowledge in which no one\\r\\ncould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a\\r\\nperfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\\r\\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery.  \"And then,\" said\\r\\nshe, \"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall\\r\\nmerely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more\\r\\nagreeable manner himself.  The liberty of communication cannot\\r\\nbe mine till it has lost all its value!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the\\r\\nreal state of her sister\\'s spirits.  Jane was not happy.  She still\\r\\ncherished a very tender affection for Bingley.  Having never even\\r\\nfancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of\\r\\nfirst attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater\\r\\nsteadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so\\r\\nfervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every\\r\\nother man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\\r\\nfeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of\\r\\nthose regrets which must have been injurious to her own health\\r\\nand their tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion\\r\\nNOW of this sad business of Jane\\'s?  For my part, I am\\r\\ndetermined never to speak of it again to anybody.  I told my\\r\\nsister Phillips so the other day.  But I cannot find out that Jane\\r\\nsaw anything of him in London.  Well, he is a very undeserving\\r\\nyoung man-- and I do not suppose there\\'s the least chance in the\\r\\nworld of her ever getting him now.  There is no talk of his\\r\\ncoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired\\r\\nof everybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses.  Nobody wants him to come.\\r\\nThough I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and\\r\\nif I was her, I would not have put up with it.  Well, my comfort\\r\\nis, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be\\r\\nsorry for what he has done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such\\r\\nexpectation, she made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother, soon afterwards, \"and so\\r\\n\\r\\nthe Collinses live very comfortable, do they?  Well, well, I only\\r\\nhope it will last.  And what sort of table do they keep?  Charlotte\\r\\nis an excellent manager, I dare say.  If she is half as sharp as her\\r\\nmother, she is saving enough.  There is nothing extravagant in\\r\\nTHEIR housekeeping, I dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.  Yes, yes.\\r\\nTHEY will take care not to outrun their income.  THEY will\\r\\nnever be distressed for money.  Well, much good may it do\\r\\nthem!  And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  They look upon it as quite their own,\\r\\nI dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no\\r\\ndoubt they often talk of it between themselves.  Well, if they can\\r\\nbe easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the\\r\\nbetter.  I should be ashamed of having one that was only\\r\\nentailed on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 41\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.\\r\\nIt was the last of the regiment\\'s stay in Meryton, and all the\\r\\nyoung ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.  The\\r\\ndejection was almost universal.  The elder Miss Bennets alone\\r\\nwere still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual\\r\\ncourse of their employments.  Very frequently were they\\r\\nreproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own\\r\\nmisery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\\r\\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven! what is to become of us?  What are we to do?\"\\r\\nwould they often exclaiming the bitterness of woe.  \"How can\\r\\nyou be smiling so, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered\\r\\nwhat she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty\\r\\nyears ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when\\r\\nColonel Miller\\'s regiment went away.  I thought I should have\\r\\nbroken my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I shall break MINE,\" said Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!-- if one could but go to Brighton!  But papa is so\\r\\ndisagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal of\\r\\ngood,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually\\r\\nthrough Longbourn House.  Elizabeth tried to be diverted by\\r\\nthem; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.  She felt anew\\r\\nthe justice of Mr. Darcy\\'s objections; and never had she been so\\r\\nmuch disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the gloom of Lydia\\'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for\\r\\nshe received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the\\r\\ncolonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.  This\\r\\ninvaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately\\r\\nmarried.  A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had\\r\\nrecommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their\\r\\nTHREE months\\' acquaintance they had been intimate TWO.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.\\r\\nForster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of\\r\\nKitty, are scarcely to be described.  Wholly inattentive to her\\r\\nsister\\'s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy,\\r\\ncalling for every one\\'s congratulations, and laughing and talking\\r\\nwith more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued\\r\\nin the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her\\r\\naccent was peevish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well as\\r\\nLydia,\" said she, \"Though I am NOT her particular friend.  I\\r\\nhave just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for\\r\\nI am two years older.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane\\r\\nto make her resigned.  As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation\\r\\nwas so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother\\r\\nand Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all\\r\\npossibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such\\r\\na step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly\\r\\nadvising her father not to let her go.  She represented to him all\\r\\nthe improprieties of Lydia\\'s general behaviour, the little\\r\\nadvantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman\\r\\nas Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\r\\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the\\r\\ntemptations must be greater than at home.  He heard her\\r\\nattentively, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some\\r\\npublic place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with\\r\\nso little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the\\r\\npresent circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great\\r\\ndisadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of\\r\\nLydia\\'s unguarded and imprudent manner-- nay, which has\\r\\nalready arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in\\r\\nthe affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet.  \"What, has she\\r\\nfrightened away some of your lovers?  Poor little Lizzy!  But do\\r\\nnot be cast down.  Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be\\r\\nconnected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.  Come,\\r\\nlet me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by\\r\\nLydia\\'s folly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken.  I have no such injuries to resent.  It is\\r\\nnot of particular, but of general evils, which I am now\\r\\ncomplaining.  Our importance, our respectability in the world\\r\\nmust be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain\\r\\nof all restraint which mark Lydia\\'s character.  Excuse me, for I\\r\\nmust speak plainly.  If you, my dear father, will not take the\\r\\ntrouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her\\r\\nthat her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she\\r\\nwill soon be beyond the reach of amendment.  Her character will\\r\\nbe fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\r\\nthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\\r\\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction\\r\\nbeyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance\\r\\n\\r\\nand emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any\\r\\nportion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration\\r\\nwill excite.  In this danger Kitty also is comprehended.  She will\\r\\nfollow wherever Lydia leads.  Vain, ignorant, idle, and\\r\\nabsolutely uncontrolled!  Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it\\r\\npossible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\\r\\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved\\r\\nin the disgrace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\r\\naffectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane\\r\\nare known you must be respected and valued; and you will not\\r\\nappear to less advantage for having a couple of-- or I may say,\\r\\nthree-- very silly sisters.  We shall have no peace at Longbourn if\\r\\nLydia does not go to Brighton.  Let her go, then.  Colonel\\r\\nForster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real\\r\\nmischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to\\r\\nanybody.  At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a\\r\\ncommon flirt than she has been here.  The officers will find\\r\\nwomen better worth their notice.  Let us hope, therefore, that\\r\\nher being there may teach her her own insignificance.  At any\\r\\nrate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising\\r\\nus to lock her up for the rest of her life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her\\r\\nown opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed\\r\\nand sorry.  It was not in her nature, however, to increase her\\r\\nvexations by dwelling on them.  She was confident of having\\r\\nperformed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or\\r\\naugment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her\\r\\nconference with her father, their indignation would hardly have\\r\\nfound expression in their united volubility.  In Lydia\\'s\\r\\nimagination, a visit to Brighton comprised ever possibility of\\r\\nearthly happiness.  She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the\\r\\nstreets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.  She saw\\r\\nherself  the object to tens and to scores of them at present\\r\\nunknown.  She saw all the glories of the camp-- its tents\\r\\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with\\r\\nthe young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to\\r\\ncomplete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent,\\r\\ntenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects\\r\\nand such realities as these, what would have been her\\r\\nsensations?  They could have been understood only by her\\r\\nmother, who might have felt nearly the same.  Lydia\\'s going to\\r\\nBrighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction\\r\\nof her husband\\'s never intending to go there himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their\\r\\nraptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of\\r\\nLydia\\'s leaving home.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.\\r\\nHaving been frequently in company with him since her return,\\r\\nagitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality\\r\\nentirely so.  She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness\\r\\nwhich had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to\\r\\ndisgust and weary.  In his present behaviour to herself,\\r\\nmoreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the\\r\\ninclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\r\\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,\\r\\nafter what had since passed, to provoke her.  She lost all concern\\r\\nfor him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle\\r\\nand frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could\\r\\nnot but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however\\r\\nlong, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn,\\r\\nher vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any\\r\\ntime by their renewal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the very last day of the regiment\\'s remaining at Meryton, he\\r\\ndined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was\\r\\nElizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his\\r\\nmaking some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had\\r\\npassed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and\\r\\nasked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked surprised displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\\'s\\r\\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly\\r\\nseen him often; and, after observing that he was a very\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him.  Her\\r\\nanswer was warmly in his favour.  With an air of indifference he\\r\\nsoon afterwards added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very different.  But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape\\r\\nher.  \"And pray, may I ask?-- \"  But checking himself, he added,\\r\\nin a gayer tone, \"Is it in address that he improves?  Has he\\r\\ndeigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?-- for I dare\\r\\nnot hope,\" he continued in a lower and more serious tone, \"that\\r\\nhe is improved in essentials.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth.  \"In essentials, I believe, he is very\\r\\nmuch what he ever was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing\\r\\nwhether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.\\r\\nThere was a something in her countenance which made him\\r\\nlisten with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean\\r\\nthat his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but\\r\\nthat, from knowing him better, his disposition was better\\r\\nunderstood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and\\r\\nagitated look; for a few minuted he was silent, till, shaking off\\r\\nhis embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the\\r\\ngentlest of accents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will\\r\\nreadily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise\\r\\nenough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is right.\\r\\nHis pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself,\\r\\nto many others, for it must only deter him from such foul\\r\\nmisconduct as I have suffered by.  I only fear that the sort of\\r\\ncautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\\r\\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion\\r\\n\\r\\nand judgement he stands much in awe.  His fear of her has\\r\\nalways operated, I know, when they were together; and a good\\r\\ndeal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with\\r\\nMiss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only\\r\\nby a slight inclination of the head.  She saw that he wanted to\\r\\nengage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in\\r\\nno humour to indulge him.  The rest of the evening passed with\\r\\nthe APPEARANCE, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with\\r\\nno further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at\\r\\nlast with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never\\r\\nmeeting again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to\\r\\nMeryton, from whence they were to set out early the next\\r\\nmorning.  The separation between her and her family was rather\\r\\nnoisy than pathetic.  Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but\\r\\nshe did weep from vexation and envy.  Mrs. Bennet was diffuse\\r\\nin her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and\\r\\nimpressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\\r\\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible-- advice\\r\\nwhich there was every reason to believe would be well attended\\r\\nto; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding\\r\\nfarewell, the more gentle adieux of her sisters were uttered\\r\\nwithout being heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 42\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Elizabeth\\'s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she\\r\\ncould not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal\\r\\nfelicity or domestic comfort.  Her father, captivated by youth\\r\\nand beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth\\r\\nand beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak\\r\\nunderstanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage\\r\\nput and end to all real affection for her.  Respect, esteem, and\\r\\nconfidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic\\r\\nhappiness were overthrown.  But Mr. Bennet was not of a\\r\\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his\\r\\nown imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which\\r\\ntoo often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice.  He\\r\\nwas fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had\\r\\narisen his principal enjoyments.  To his wife he was very little\\r\\n\\r\\notherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had\\r\\ncontributed to his amusement.  This is not the sort of happiness\\r\\nwhich a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but\\r\\nwhere other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\\r\\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of\\r\\nher father\\'s behaviour as a husband.  She had always seen it with\\r\\npain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate\\r\\ntreatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could\\r\\nnot overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual\\r\\nbreach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing\\r\\nhis wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly\\r\\nreprehensible.  But she had never felt so strongly as now the\\r\\ndisadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a\\r\\nmarriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from\\r\\nso ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\\r\\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,\\r\\neven if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\\'s departure she\\r\\nfound little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the\\r\\nregiment.  Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and\\r\\nat home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at\\r\\nthe dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over\\r\\ntheir domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her\\r\\nnatural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were\\r\\nremoved, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil\\r\\nmight be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly\\r\\nand assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\r\\nwatering-place and a camp.  Upon the whole, therefore, she\\r\\nfound, what has been sometimes been found before, that an\\r\\nevent to which she had been looking with impatient desire did\\r\\nnot, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised\\r\\nherself.  It was consequently necessary to name some other\\r\\nperiod for the commencement of actual felicity-- to have some\\r\\nother point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and\\r\\nby again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for\\r\\nthe present, and prepare for another disappointment.  Her tour\\r\\nto the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was\\r\\nher best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the\\r\\ndiscontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and\\r\\ncould she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it\\r\\nwould have been perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish\\r\\nfor.  Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment\\r\\nwould be certain.  But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless\\r\\nsource of regret in my sister\\'s absence, I may reasonably hope to\\r\\nhave all my expectations of pleasure realised.  A scheme of\\r\\nwhich every part promises delight can never be successful; and\\r\\ngeneral disappointment is only warded off by the defence of\\r\\nsome little peculiar vexation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and\\r\\nvery minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were\\r\\nalways long expected, and always very short.  Those to her\\r\\nmother contained little else than that they were just returned\\r\\nfrom the library, where such and such officers had attended\\r\\nthem, and where she had seen such beautiful  ornaments as made\\r\\nher quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\\r\\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave\\r\\noff in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were\\r\\ngoing off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her\\r\\nsister,  there was still less to be learnt-- for her letters to Kitty,\\r\\nthough rather longer, were much too full of lines under the\\r\\nwords to be made public.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\\r\\ngood humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.\\r\\nEverything wore a happier aspect.  The families who had been in\\r\\ntown for the winter came back again, and summer finery and\\r\\nsummer engagements arose.  Mrs. Bennet was restored to her\\r\\nusual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was\\r\\nso much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears;\\r\\nan event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that\\r\\nby the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable\\r\\nas not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some\\r\\ncruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another\\r\\nregiment should be quartered in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now\\r\\nfast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a\\r\\nletter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its\\r\\ncommencement and curtailed its extent.  Mr. Gardiner would be\\r\\nprevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in\\r\\nJuly, and must be in London again within a month, and as that\\r\\nleft too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much\\r\\nas they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and\\r\\ncomfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the\\r\\n\\r\\nLakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to\\r\\nthe present plan, were to go no farther northwards than\\r\\nDerbyshire.  In that county there was enough to be seen to\\r\\noccupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it\\r\\nhad a peculiarly strong attraction.  The town where she had\\r\\nformerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now\\r\\nto spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her\\r\\ncuriosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\\r\\nDovedale, or the Peak.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on\\r\\nseeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time\\r\\nenough.  But it was her business to be satisfied-- and certainly\\r\\nher temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas\\r\\nconnected.  It was impossible for her to see the word without\\r\\nthinking of Pemberley and its owner.  \"But surely,\" said she, \"I\\r\\nmay enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few\\r\\npetrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled.  Four weeks were\\r\\nto pass away before her uncle and aunt\\'s arrival.  But they did\\r\\npass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children,\\r\\ndid at length appear at Longbourn.  The children, two girls of six\\r\\nand eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under\\r\\nthe particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general\\r\\nfavourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper\\r\\nexactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--\\r\\nteaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off\\r\\nthe next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and\\r\\namusement.  One enjoyment was certain-- that of suitableness of\\r\\ncompanions; a suitableness which comprehended health and\\r\\ntemper to bear inconveniences-- cheerfulness to enhance every\\r\\npleasure-- and affection and intelligence, which might supply it\\r\\namong themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of\\r\\nDerbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which\\r\\ntheir route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,\\r\\nBirmingham, &c., are sufficiently known.  A small part of\\r\\nDerbyshire is all the present concern.  To the little town of\\r\\nLambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s former residence, and\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained,\\r\\nthey bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders\\r\\nof the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth\\r\\nfound from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.  It was not in\\r\\ntheir direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.  In\\r\\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner\\r\\nexpressed an inclination to see the place again.  Mr. Gardiner\\r\\ndeclared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her\\r\\napprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have\\r\\nheard so much?\" said her aunt; \"a place, too, with which so\\r\\nmany of your acquaintances are connected.  Wickham passed all\\r\\nhis youth there, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was distressed.  She felt that she had no business at\\r\\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\\r\\nit.  She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\\r\\ngoing over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\\r\\nsatin curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.  If it were merely a fine\\r\\nhouse richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it\\r\\nmyself; but the grounds are delightful.  They have some of the\\r\\nfinest woods in the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said no more-- but her mind could not acquiesce.  The\\r\\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,\\r\\ninstantly occurred.  It would be dreadful!  She blushed at the\\r\\nvery idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her\\r\\naunt than to run such a risk.  But against this there were\\r\\nobjections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last\\r\\nresource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family\\r\\nwere unfavourably answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the\\r\\nchambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place?\\r\\nwhat was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm,\\r\\nwhether the family were down for the summer?  A most\\r\\nwelcome negative followed the last question-- and her alarms\\r\\nnow being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\\r\\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was\\r\\nrevived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could\\r\\nreadily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had\\r\\nnot really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore,\\r\\nthey were to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 43\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance\\r\\nof Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at\\r\\nlength they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high\\r\\nflutter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\\r\\nThey entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some\\r\\ntime through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\\r\\nadmired every remarkable spot and point of view.  They\\r\\ngradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves\\r\\nat the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased,\\r\\nand the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated\\r\\non the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some\\r\\nabruptness wound.  It was a large, handsome stone building,\\r\\nstanding well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\\r\\nwoody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance\\r\\nwas swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.\\r\\nIts banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwas delighted.  She had never seen a place for which nature had\\r\\ndone more, or where natural beauty had been so little\\r\\ncounteracted by an awkward taste.  They were all of them warm\\r\\nin their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be\\r\\nmistress of Pemberley might be something!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the\\r\\ndoor; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all\\r\\nher apprehension of meeting its owner returned.  She dreaded\\r\\nlest the chambermaid had been mistaken.  On applying to see\\r\\nthe place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as\\r\\nthey waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her\\r\\nbeing where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman,\\r\\nmuch less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of\\r\\nfinding her.  They followed her into the dining-parlour.  It was\\r\\na large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.\\r\\nElizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy\\r\\nits prospect.  The hill, crowned with wood, which they had\\r\\ndescended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\\r\\nwas a beautiful object.  Every disposition of the ground was\\r\\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees\\r\\nscattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as\\r\\nshe could trace it, with delight.  As they passed into other\\r\\nrooms these objects were taking different positions; but from\\r\\nevery window there were beauties to be seen.  The rooms were\\r\\nlofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune\\r\\nof its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste,\\r\\nthat it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\\r\\nsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress!\\r\\nWith these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!\\r\\nInstead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in\\r\\nthem as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle\\r\\nand aunt.  But no,\" recollecting herself-- \"that could never be;\\r\\nmy uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not\\r\\nhave been allowed to invite them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a lucky recollection-- it saved her from something\\r\\nvery like regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master\\r\\nwas really absent, but had not the courage for it.  At length\\r\\nhowever, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned\\r\\naway with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was,\\r\\nadding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of\\r\\nfriends.\"  How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey\\r\\nhad not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture.  She approached\\r\\nand saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst\\r\\nseveral other miniatures, over the mantelpiece.  Her aunt asked\\r\\nher, smilingly, how she liked it.  The housekeeper came forward,\\r\\nand told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of\\r\\nher late master\\'s steward, who had been brought up by him at\\r\\nhis own expense.  \"He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\\r\\n\"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not return it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the\\r\\nminiatures, \"is my master-- and very like him.  It was drawn at\\r\\nthe same time as the other-- about eight years ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard much of your master\\'s fine person,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face.  But,\\r\\nLizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\r\\nintimation of her knowing her master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\\'am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery\\r\\nupstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.\\r\\nThis room was my late master\\'s favourite room, and these\\r\\nminiatures are just as they used to be then.  He was very fond\\r\\nof them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\\'s being among\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss\\r\\nDarcy, drawn when she was only eight\\r\\nyears old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and\\r\\nso accomplished!-- She plays and sings all day long.  In the next\\r\\nroom is a new instrument just come down for her-- a present\\r\\nfrom my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,\\r\\nencouraged her communicativeness by his questions and\\r\\nremarks:  Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had\\r\\nevidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend\\r\\nhalf his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the\\r\\nsummer months.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when THAT will be.  I do not\\r\\nknow who is good enough for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.  Elizabeth could not help saying,\\r\\n\"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think\\r\\nso.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that\\r\\nknows him,\" replied the other.  Elizabeth thought this was\\r\\ngoing pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment\\r\\nas the housekeeper added, \"I have never known a cross word\\r\\nfrom him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was\\r\\nfour years old.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite\\r\\nto her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been\\r\\nher firmest opinion.  Her keenest attention was awakened; she\\r\\nlonged to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.  You\\r\\nare lucky in having such a master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am.  If I were to go through the world, I\\r\\ncould not meet with a better.  But I have always observed, that\\r\\nthey who are good-natured when children, are good-natured\\r\\nwhen they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered,\\r\\nmost generous-hearted boy in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth almost stared at her.  \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\nthought she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like\\r\\nhim-- just as affable to the poor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for\\r\\nmore.  Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She\\r\\nrelated the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms,\\r\\nand the price of the furniture, in vain, Mr. Gardiner, highly\\r\\namused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed\\r\\nher excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to\\r\\nthe subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as\\r\\nthey proceeded together up the great staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that\\r\\never lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of\\r\\nnothing but themselves.  There is not one of his tenants or\\r\\nservants but will give him a good name.  Some people call him\\r\\nproud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it.  To my fancy, it\\r\\nis only because he does not rattle away like other young men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked,\\r\\n\"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a\\r\\nvery pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance\\r\\nand lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that\\r\\nit was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had\\r\\ntaken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked\\r\\ntowards one of the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\\'s delight, when she\\r\\nshould enter the room.  \"And this is always the way with him,\"\\r\\nshe added.  \"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to\\r\\nbe done in a moment.  There is nothing he would not do for\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,\\r\\nwere all that remained to be shown.  In the former were many\\r\\ngood paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from\\r\\nsuch as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned\\r\\nto look at some drawings of Miss Darcy\\'s, in crayons, whose\\r\\nsubjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could\\r\\nhave little to fix the attention of a stranger.  Elizabeth walked in\\r\\nquest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\\r\\nAt last it arrested her-- and she beheld a striking resemblance to\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered\\r\\nto have sometimes seen when he looked at her.  She stood\\r\\nseveral minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation,\\r\\nand returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.  Mrs.\\r\\nReynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\\'s\\r\\nlifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\\'s mind, a more\\r\\ngentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at\\r\\nthe height of their acquaintance.  The commendation bestowed\\r\\non him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise\\r\\nis more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?  As a\\r\\nbrother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people\\'s\\r\\nhappiness were in his guardianship!-- how much of pleasure or\\r\\npain was it in his power to bestow!-- how much of good or evil\\r\\nmust be done by him!  Every idea that had been brought forward\\r\\nby the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\\r\\nstood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed\\r\\nhis eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper\\r\\nsentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she\\r\\nremembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of\\r\\nexpression.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had\\r\\nbeen seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the\\r\\nhousekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met\\r\\nthem at the hall-door.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth\\r\\nturned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and\\r\\nwhile the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,\\r\\nthe owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,\\r\\nwhich led behind it to the stables.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was\\r\\nhis appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.  Their\\r\\neyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with\\r\\nthe deepest blush.  He absolutely started, and for a moment\\r\\nseemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself,\\r\\nadvanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in\\r\\nterms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\r\\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to\\r\\nbe overcome.  Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to\\r\\nthe picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to\\r\\nassure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the\\r\\ngardener\\'s expression of surprise, on beholding his master,\\r\\nmust immediately have told it.  They stood a little aloof while\\r\\nhe was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\\r\\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what\\r\\nanswer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.\\r\\nAmazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted,\\r\\nevery sentence that he uttered was increasing her\\r\\nembarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her\\r\\nbeing found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in\\r\\nwhich they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\\r\\nher life.  Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke,\\r\\nhis accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\\r\\ninquiries as to the time of  her having left Longbourn, and of her\\r\\nhaving stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way,\\r\\nas plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a\\r\\nfew moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected\\r\\nhimself, and took leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his\\r\\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed\\r\\nby her own feelings, followed them in silence.  She was\\r\\noverpowered by shame and vexation.  Her coming there was\\r\\nthe most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!\\r\\nHow strange it must appear to him!  In what a disgraceful light\\r\\nmight it not strike so vain a man!  It might seem as if she had\\r\\npurposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she\\r\\ncome?  Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?\\r\\nHad they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been\\r\\nbeyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he\\r\\nwas that moment arrived-- that moment alighted from his horse\\r\\nor his carriage.  She blushed again and again over the\\r\\nperverseness of the meeting.  And his behaviour, so strikingly\\r\\naltered-- what could it mean?  That he should even speak to her\\r\\nwas amazing!-- but to speak with such civility, to inquire after\\r\\nher family!  Never in her life had she seen his manners so little\\r\\ndignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this\\r\\nunexpected meeting.  What a contrast did it offer to his last\\r\\naddress in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!\\r\\nShe  knew not what to think, or how to account for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\\r\\nand every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or\\r\\na finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but\\r\\nit was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\\r\\nthough she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of\\r\\nher uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such\\r\\nobjects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the\\r\\nscene.  Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of\\r\\nPemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\\r\\nwas.  She longed to know what at the moment was passing in\\r\\nhis mind-- in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in\\r\\ndefiance of everything, she was still dear to him.  Perhaps he\\r\\nhad been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had\\r\\nbeen THAT in his voice which was not like ease.  Whether he\\r\\nhad felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not\\r\\ntell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her\\r\\nabsence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of\\r\\nappearing more like herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\\r\\nwhile, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots\\r\\nwhere the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander,\\r\\nwere many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills,\\r\\nwith the long range of woods overspreading many, and\\r\\noccasionally part of the stream.  Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\\r\\nof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a\\r\\nwalk.  With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten\\r\\nmiles round.  It settled the matter; and they pursued the\\r\\naccustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time,\\r\\nin a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water,\\r\\nand one of its narrowest parts.  They crossed it by a simple\\r\\nbridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a\\r\\nspot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley,\\r\\nhere contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\\r\\nand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which\\r\\nbordered it.  Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when\\r\\nthey had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from\\r\\nthe house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go\\r\\nno farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as\\r\\nquickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit,\\r\\nand they took their way towards the house on the opposite side\\r\\nof the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was\\r\\nslow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste,\\r\\nwas very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching\\r\\nthe occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and\\r\\ntalking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.\\r\\nWhilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again\\r\\nsurprised, and Elizabeth\\'s astonishment was quite equal to what\\r\\nit had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them,\\r\\nand at no great distance.  The walk here being here less\\r\\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\r\\nthey met.  Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\\r\\nprepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear\\r\\nand to speak with calmness, if we really intended to meet them.\\r\\nFor a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably\\r\\nstrike into some other path.  The idea lasted while a turning in\\r\\nthe walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he\\r\\nwas immediately before them.  With a glance, she saw that he\\r\\nhad lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\\r\\npoliteness, she began as they to admire the beauty of the place;\\r\\nbut she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and\\r\\n\"charming,\" when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she\\r\\nfancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be\\r\\nmischievously construed.  Her colour changed, and she said no\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\\r\\nhe asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him\\r\\nto her friends.  This was a stroke of civility for which she was\\r\\nquite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\\r\\nbeing now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very\\r\\npeople against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to\\r\\nherself.  \"What will be his surprise,\" thought she, \"when he\\r\\nknows who they are?  He takes them now for people of\\r\\nfashion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she\\r\\nnamed their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him,\\r\\nto see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of\\r\\nhis decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful\\r\\ncompanions.  That he was SURPRISED by the connection was\\r\\nevident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from\\r\\ngoing away, turned his back with them, and entered into\\r\\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner.  Elizabeth could not but be\\r\\npleased, could not but triumph.  It was consoling that he should\\r\\nknow she had some relations for whom there was no need to\\r\\nblush.  She listened most attentively to all that passed between\\r\\nthem, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her\\r\\nuncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good\\r\\nmanners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\\r\\nDarcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often\\r\\nas he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering\\r\\nat the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing\\r\\nout those parts of the stream where there was usually most\\r\\nsport.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\\r\\nElizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.  Elizabeth\\r\\nsaid nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\\r\\nmust be all for herself.  Her astonishment, however, was\\r\\nextreme, and continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so\\r\\naltered?  From what can it proceed?  It cannot be for ME-- it\\r\\ncannot be for MY sake that his manners are thus softened.  My\\r\\nreproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.  It\\r\\nis impossible that he should still love me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\\r\\ntwo gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after\\r\\ndescending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of\\r\\nsome curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.\\r\\nIt originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of\\r\\nthe morning, found Elizabeth\\'s arm inadequate to her support,\\r\\nand consequently preferred her husband\\'s.  Mr. Darcy took her\\r\\nplace by her niece, and they walked on together.  After a short\\r\\nsilence, the lady first spoke.  She wished him to know that she\\r\\nhad been assured of his absence before she came to the place,\\r\\nand accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\\r\\nvery unexpected-- \"for your housekeeper,\" she added,\\r\\n\"informed us that you would certainly not be here till\\r\\nto-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we\\r\\nunderstood that you were not immediately expected in the\\r\\ncountry.\"  He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\\r\\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a\\r\\nfew hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been\\r\\ntravelling.  \"They will join me early to-morrow ,\" he continued,\\r\\n\"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with\\r\\nyou-- Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow.  Her thoughts were\\r\\ninstantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\\'s name had\\r\\nbeen the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge\\r\\nby his complexion, HIS mind was not very differently engaged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after\\r\\na pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you.\\r\\nWill you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister\\r\\nto your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\\r\\ngreat for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.  She\\r\\nimmediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\\r\\nbeing acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\\r\\nwithout looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to\\r\\nknow that is resentment had not made him think really ill of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\\r\\nElizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\\r\\nflattered and pleased.  His wish of introducing his sister to her\\r\\nwas a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\\r\\nothers, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house-- but she declared\\r\\nherself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.  At such\\r\\na time much might have been said, and silence was very\\r\\nawkward.  She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an\\r\\nembargo on every subject.  At last she recollected that she had\\r\\nbeen travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\\r\\ngreat perseverance.  Yet time and her aunt moved slowly-- and\\r\\nher patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before the\\r\\ntete-a-tete was over.  On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s coming up\\r\\nthey were all pressed to go into the house and take some\\r\\nrefreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each\\r\\nside with utmost politeness.  Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into\\r\\nthe carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking\\r\\nslowly towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\\r\\nthem pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\\r\\nhad expected.  \"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\\r\\nunassuming,\" said her uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There IS something a little stately in him, to be sure,\" replied her\\r\\naunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.  I can\\r\\nnow say with the housekeeper, that though some people may\\r\\ncall him proud, I have seen nothing of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.  It was\\r\\nmore than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity\\r\\nfor such attention.  His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very\\r\\ntrifling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as\\r\\nWickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham\\'s countenance, for\\r\\nhis features are perfectly good.  But how came you to tell me\\r\\nthat he was so disagreeable?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\\r\\nliked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\\r\\nshe had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\"\\r\\nreplied her uncle.  \"Your great men often are; and therefore I\\r\\nshall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\\r\\nanother day, and warn me off his grounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character,\\r\\nbut said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I\\r\\nreally should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\\r\\ncruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham.  He\\r\\nhas not an ill-natured look.  On the contrary, there is something\\r\\npleasing about his mouth when he speaks.  And there is\\r\\nsomething of dignity in his countenance that would not give one\\r\\nan unfavourable idea of his heart.  But, to be sure, the good lady\\r\\nwho showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\\r\\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.  But he is a liberal\\r\\nmaster, I suppose, and THAT in the eye of a servant\\r\\ncomprehends every virtue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\\r\\nvindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave\\r\\nthem to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that\\r\\nby what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions\\r\\nwere capable of a very different construction; and that his\\r\\ncharacter was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham\\'s so amiable,\\r\\nas they had been considered in Hertfordshire.  In confirmation\\r\\nof this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\\r\\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually\\r\\nnaming her authority, but stating as such as might be relied on.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were\\r\\nnow approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea\\r\\ngave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much\\r\\nengaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots\\r\\nin its environs to think of anything else.  Fatigued as she had\\r\\nbeen by the morning\\'s walk they had no sooner dined than she\\r\\nset off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the\\r\\nevening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed\\r\\nafter many years\\' discontinuance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave\\r\\nElizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she\\r\\ncould do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be\\r\\nacquainted with his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 44\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to\\r\\nvisit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was\\r\\nconsequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole\\r\\nof that morning.  But her conclusion was false; for on the very\\r\\nmorning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.\\r\\nThey had been walking about the place with some of their new\\r\\nfriends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves\\r\\nfor dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage\\r\\ndrew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady\\r\\nin a curricle driving up the street.  Elizabeth immediately\\r\\nrecognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no\\r\\nsmall degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them\\r\\nwith the honour which she expected.  Her uncle and aunt were\\r\\nall amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she\\r\\nspoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the\\r\\ncircumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea\\r\\non the business.  Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they\\r\\nfelt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions\\r\\nfrom such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.\\r\\nWhile these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the\\r\\nperturbation of Elizabeth\\'s feelings was at every moment\\r\\nincreasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but\\r\\namongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality\\r\\nof the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more\\r\\nthan commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that\\r\\nevery power of pleasing would fail her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she\\r\\nwalked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose\\r\\nherself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and\\r\\naunt as made everything worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\\r\\nintroduction took place.  With astonishment did Elizabeth see\\r\\nthat her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as\\r\\nherself.  Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss\\r\\nDarcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few\\r\\nminutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.  She\\r\\nfound it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a\\r\\nmonosyllable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\\r\\nthough little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\\r\\nappearance womanly and graceful.  She was less handsome than\\r\\nher brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face,\\r\\nand her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.\\r\\nElizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and\\r\\nunembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was\\r\\nmuch relieved by discerning such different feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that\\r\\nBingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time\\r\\nto express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when\\r\\nBingley\\'s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he\\r\\nentered the room.  All Elizabeth\\'s anger against him had been\\r\\nlong done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have\\r\\nstood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he\\r\\nexpressed himself on seeing her again.  He inquired in a friendly,\\r\\nthough general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with\\r\\nthe same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting\\r\\npersonage than to herself.  They had long wished to see him.\\r\\nThe whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.\\r\\nThe suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their\\r\\nniece directed their observation towards each with an earnest\\r\\nthough guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those\\r\\ninquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\\r\\nit was to love.  Of the lady\\'s sensations they remained a little in\\r\\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration\\r\\nwas evident enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do.  She wanted to\\r\\nascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to\\r\\ncompose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in\\r\\nthe latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most\\r\\nsure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give\\r\\npleasure were prepossessed in her favour.  Bingley was ready,\\r\\nGeorgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and,\\r\\noh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were\\r\\ndirected in a like manner.  Sometimes she could fancy that he\\r\\ntalked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\\r\\nherself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to\\r\\ntrace a resemblance .  But, though this might be imaginary, she\\r\\ncould not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who\\r\\nhad been set up as a rival to Jane.  No look appeared on either\\r\\nside that spoke particular regard.  Nothing occurred between\\r\\nthem that could justify the hopes of his sister.  On this point she\\r\\nwas soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances\\r\\noccurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation,\\r\\ndenoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness,\\r\\nand a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her,\\r\\nhad he dared.  He observed to her, at a moment when the others\\r\\nwere talking together, and in a tone which had something of real\\r\\nregret, that it \"was a very long time since he had had the\\r\\npleasure of seeing her\"; and, before she could reply, he added,\\r\\n\"It is above eight months.  We have not met since the 26th of\\r\\nNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\\r\\nafterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by\\r\\nany of the rest, whether ALL her sisters were at Longbourn.\\r\\nThere was not much in the question, nor in the preceding\\r\\nremark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\\r\\nexpression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\\r\\nheard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his\\r\\ncompanions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners\\r\\nwhich she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its\\r\\nexistence might prove, had at least outlived one day.  When she\\r\\nsaw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good\\r\\nopinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago\\r\\nwould have been a disgrace-- when she saw him thus civil, not\\r\\nonly to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly\\r\\ndisdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford\\r\\nParsonage-- the difference, the change was so great, and struck\\r\\nso forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her\\r\\nastonishment from being visible.  Never, even in the company of\\r\\nhis dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at\\r\\nRosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\\r\\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no\\r\\nimportance could result from the success of his endeavours, and\\r\\nwhen even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions\\r\\nwere addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of\\r\\nthe ladies both of Netherfield as Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when\\r\\nthey arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him\\r\\nin expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and\\r\\nMiss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the\\r\\ncountry.  Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked\\r\\nher little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.  Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how SHE,\\r\\nwhom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\\r\\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.  Presuming\\r\\nhowever, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary\\r\\nembarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her\\r\\nhusband, who was fond or society, a perfect willingness to\\r\\naccept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the\\r\\nday after the next was fixed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing\\r\\nElizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many\\r\\ninquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nconstruing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister,\\r\\nwas pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found\\r\\nherself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the\\r\\nlast half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was\\r\\npassing, the enjoyment of it had been little.  Eager to be alone,\\r\\nand fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she\\r\\nstayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable\\r\\nopinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s curiosity;\\r\\nit was not their wish to force her communication.  It was evident\\r\\nthat she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they\\r\\nhad before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in\\r\\nlove with her.  They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify\\r\\ninquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,\\r\\nas far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.\\r\\nThey could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they\\r\\ndrawn his character from their own feelings and his servant\\'s\\r\\nreport, without any reference to any other account, the circle in\\r\\nHertfordshire to which he was known would not have\\r\\nrecognized it for Mr. Darcy.  There was now an interest,\\r\\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became\\r\\nsensible that the authority of a servant who had known him\\r\\nsince he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated\\r\\nrespectability, was not to be hastily rejected.  Neither had\\r\\nanything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends\\r\\nthat could materially lessen its weight.  They had nothing to\\r\\naccuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it\\r\\nwould certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small\\r\\nmarket-town where the family did not visit.  It was\\r\\nacknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did\\r\\nmuch good among the poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was\\r\\nnot held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his\\r\\nconcerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly\\r\\nunderstood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting\\r\\nDerbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.\\r\\nDarcy afterwards discharged.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening\\r\\nmore than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it\\r\\nseemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings\\r\\ntowards ONE in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole\\r\\nhours endeavouring to make them out.  She certainly did not\\r\\nhate him.  No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had\\r\\nalmost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against\\r\\nhim, that could be so called.  The respect created by the\\r\\nconviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly\\r\\nadmitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her\\r\\nfeeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier\\r\\nnature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing\\r\\nforward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday\\r\\nhad produced.  But above all, above respect and esteem, there\\r\\nwas  a motive within her of goodwill which could not be\\r\\noverlooked.  It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having\\r\\nonce loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all\\r\\nthe petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and\\r\\nall the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.  He who,\\r\\nshe had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy,\\r\\nseemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the\\r\\nacquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or\\r\\nany peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were\\r\\nconcerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and\\r\\nbent on making her known to his sister.  Such a change in a\\r\\nman of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but\\r\\ngratitude-- for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as\\r\\nsuch its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by\\r\\nno means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.\\r\\nShe respected, she esteemed, he was grateful to him, she felt a\\r\\nreal interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\\r\\nfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far\\r\\nit would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the\\r\\npower, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing\\r\\non her the renewal of his addresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the\\r\\nniece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\\'s in coming to\\r\\nsee them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she\\r\\nhad reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated,\\r\\nthough it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness\\r\\non their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly\\r\\nexpedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.\\r\\nThey were, therefore, to go.  Elizabeth was pleased; though\\r\\nwhen she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in\\r\\nreply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.  The fishing scheme\\r\\nhad been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement\\r\\nmade of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before\\r\\nnoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 45\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\\'s dislike of\\r\\nher had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how\\r\\nunwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and\\r\\nwas curious to know with how much civility on that lady\\'s side\\r\\nthe acquaintance would now be renewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into\\r\\nthe saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for\\r\\nsummer.  Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most\\r\\nrefreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and\\r\\nof the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were\\r\\nscattered over the intermediate lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was\\r\\nsitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady\\r\\nwith whom she lived in London.  Georgiana\\'s reception of them\\r\\nwas very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which,\\r\\nthough proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong,\\r\\nwould easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief\\r\\nof her being proud and reserved.  Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\\r\\nhowever, did her justice, and pitied her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a\\r\\ncurtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such\\r\\npauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.  It was\\r\\nfirst broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking\\r\\nwoman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse\\r\\nproved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others;\\r\\nand between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\\r\\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on.  Miss Darcy looked\\r\\nas if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes\\r\\ndid venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its\\r\\nbeing heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss\\r\\nBingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss\\r\\nDarcy, without calling her attention.  This observation would not\\r\\nhave prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not\\r\\nbeen seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to\\r\\nbe spared the necessity of saying much.  Her own thoughts were\\r\\nemploying her.  She expected every moment that some of the\\r\\ngentlemen would enter the room.  She wished, she feared that\\r\\nthe master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\\r\\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.\\r\\nAfter sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from\\r\\nher a cold inquiry after the health of her family.  She answered\\r\\nwith equal indifference and brevity, and the others said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by\\r\\nthe entrance of the servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety\\r\\nof all the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a\\r\\nvariety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take\\r\\nplace till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.\\r\\nAnnesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her\\r\\npost.  There was now employment for the whole party-- for\\r\\nthough they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\\r\\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon\\r\\ncollected them round the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding\\r\\nwhether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;\\r\\nand then, though but a moment before she had believed her\\r\\nwishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or\\r\\nthree other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river,\\r\\nand had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family\\r\\nintended a visit to Georgiana that morning.  No sooner did he\\r\\nappear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and\\r\\nunembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but\\r\\nperhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the\\r\\nsuspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and\\r\\nthat there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his\\r\\nbehaviour when he first came into the room.  In no countenance\\r\\nwas attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nin spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she\\r\\nspoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her\\r\\ndesperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means\\r\\nover.  Miss Darcy, on her brother\\'s entrance, exerted herself\\r\\nmuch more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that she was anxious for\\r\\nhis sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much\\r\\nas possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.  Miss\\r\\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger,\\r\\ntook the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from\\r\\nMeryton?  They must be a great loss to YOUR family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Darcy\\'s presence she dared not mention Wickham\\'s name;\\r\\nbut Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in\\r\\nher thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him\\r\\ngave her a moment\\'s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to\\r\\nrepel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question\\r\\nin a tolerably detached tone.  While she spoke, an involuntary\\r\\nglance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion,\\r\\nearnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion,\\r\\nand unable to lift up her eyes.  Had Miss Bingley know what\\r\\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly\\r\\nwould have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended\\r\\nto discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man\\r\\nto whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility\\r\\nwhich might injure her in Darcy\\'s opinion, and, perhaps, to\\r\\nremind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some\\r\\npart of her family were connected with that corps.  Not a\\r\\nsyllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\\'s meditated\\r\\nelopement.  To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\\r\\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\\'s\\r\\nconnections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it,\\r\\nfrom the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to\\r\\nhim, of their becoming hereafter her own.  He had certainly\\r\\nformed such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect\\r\\nhis endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable\\r\\n that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare\\r\\nof his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his\\r\\nemotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared\\r\\nnot approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in\\r\\ntime, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her\\r\\nbrother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her\\r\\ninterest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been\\r\\ndesigned to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\\r\\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer\\r\\nabove mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to\\r\\ntheir carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms\\r\\non Elizabeth\\'s person, behaviour, and dress.  But Georgiana\\r\\nwould not join her.  Her brother\\'s recommendation was enough\\r\\nto ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had\\r\\nspoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without\\r\\nthe power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.\\r\\nWhen Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\\r\\n repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\"\\r\\nshe cried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she\\r\\nis since the winter.  She is grown so brown and coarse!  Louisa\\r\\nand I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he\\r\\ncontented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no\\r\\nother alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous\\r\\nconsequence of travelling in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never\\r\\ncould see any beauty in her.  Her face is too thin; her\\r\\ncomplexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all\\r\\nhandsome.  Her nose wants character-- there is nothing marked\\r\\nin its lines.  Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common\\r\\nway; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so\\r\\nfine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them.  They\\r\\nhave a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her\\r\\nair altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is\\r\\nintolerable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth,\\r\\nthis was not the best method of recommending herself; but\\r\\nangry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look\\r\\nsomewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.  He was\\r\\nresolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making\\r\\nhim speak, she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how\\r\\namazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I\\r\\nparticularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been\\r\\ndining at Netherfield, \\'SHE a beauty!  I should as soon call her\\r\\nmother a wit.\\'  But afterwards she seemed to improve on you,\\r\\nand I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but\\r\\nTHAT was only when I first saw her, for it is many months\\r\\nsince I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of\\r\\nmy acquaintances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\\r\\nsatisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\\r\\npain but herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned,\\r\\nexcept what had particularly interested them both.  The look and behaviour of everybody they had\\r\\nseen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.  They talked\\r\\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit-- of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing\\r\\nto know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified\\r\\nby her niece\\'s beginning the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 46\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival\\r\\nat Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now\\r\\nbeen spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of\\r\\ntwo letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.\\r\\nElizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to\\r\\nenjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.  The one missent must first be attended to; it had been\\r\\nwritten five days ago.  The beginning contained an account of\\r\\nall their little parties and engagements, with such news as the\\r\\ncountry afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day\\r\\nlater, and written in evident agitation, gave more important\\r\\nintelligence.  It was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred\\r\\nof a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of\\r\\nalarming you-- be assured that we are all well.  What I have to\\r\\nsay relates to poor Lydia.  An express came at twelve last night,\\r\\n just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to\\r\\ninform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his\\r\\nofficers; to own the truth, with Wickham!  Imagine our surprise.\\r\\nTo Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.  I\\r\\nam very, very sorry.  So imprudent a match on both sides! But I\\r\\nam willing to hope the best, and that his character has been\\r\\nmisunderstood.  Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe\\r\\nhim, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad\\r\\nat heart.  His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know\\r\\nmy father can give her nothing.  Our poor mother is sadly\\r\\ngrieved.  My father bears it better.  How thankful am I that we\\r\\nnever let them know what has been said against him!  we must\\r\\nforget it ourselves.  They were off Saturday night about twelve,\\r\\nas is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\\r\\neight.  The express was sent off directly.  My dear Lizzy, they\\r\\nmust have passed within ten miles of us.  Colonel Forster gives\\r\\nus reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his\\r\\nwife, informing her of their intention.  I must conclude, for I\\r\\ncannot be long from my poor mother.  I am afraid you will not\\r\\nbe able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely\\r\\nknowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly\\r\\nseized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read\\r\\nas follows:  it had been written a day later than the conclusion of\\r\\nthe first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\\r\\nletter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\\r\\nconfined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\\r\\nfor being coherent.  Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\\r\\nwrite, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\\r\\nImprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor\\r\\nLydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken\\r\\nplace, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\\r\\nto Scotland.  Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left\\r\\nBrighton the day before, not many hours after the express.\\r\\nThough Lydia\\'s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand\\r\\nthat they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped\\r\\nby Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go\\r\\nthere, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel\\r\\nF., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B., intending to\\r\\ntrace their route.  He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no\\r\\nfurther; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\\r\\ncoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\\r\\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue\\r\\nthe London road.  I know not what to think.  After making\\r\\nevery possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on\\r\\ninto Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes,\\r\\nand at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--\\r\\nno such people had been seen to pass through.  With the kindest\\r\\nconcern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\\r\\nto us in a manner most creditable to his heart.  I am sincerely\\r\\ngrieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame\\r\\non them.  Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.  My father\\r\\nand mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.\\r\\nMany circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be\\r\\nmarried privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even\\r\\nif HE could form such a design against a young woman of\\r\\nLydia\\'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so\\r\\nlost to everything?  Impossible!  I grieve to find, however, that\\r\\nColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he\\r\\nshook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W.\\r\\nwas not a man to be trusted.  My poor mother is really ill, and\\r\\nkeeps her room.  Could she exert herself, it would be better; but\\r\\nthis is not to be expected.  And as to my father, I never in my\\r\\nlife saw him so affected.  Poor Kitty has anger for having\\r\\nconcealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,\\r\\none cannot wonder.  I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\\r\\nhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but\\r\\nnow, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your\\r\\nreturn?  I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if\\r\\ninconvenient.  Adieu!  I take up my pen again to do what I\\r\\nhave just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that\\r\\nI cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as\\r\\npossible.  I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\\r\\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\\r\\nask of the former.  My father is going to London with Colonel\\r\\nForster instantly, to try to discover her.  What he means to do\\r\\nI am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow\\r\\nhim to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and\\r\\nColonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow\\r\\nevening.  In such and exigence, my uncle\\'s advice and assistance\\r\\nwould be everything in the world; he will immediately\\r\\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from\\r\\nher seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,\\r\\nwithout losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she\\r\\nreached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy\\r\\nappeared.  Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start,\\r\\nand before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose\\r\\nmind every idea was superseded by Lydia\\'s situation, hastily\\r\\nexclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.  I must\\r\\nfind Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be\\r\\ndelayed; I have not an instant to loose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling\\r\\nthan politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you\\r\\na minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.  You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she\\r\\nfelt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.\\r\\nCalling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him,\\r\\nthough in so breathless an accent as made her almost\\r\\nunintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support\\r\\nherself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for\\r\\nDarcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of\\r\\ngentleness and commiseration, \"Let me call your maid.  Is\\r\\nthere nothing you could take to give you present relief?  A\\r\\nglass of wine; shall I get you one?  You are very ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.\\r\\n \"There is nothing the matter with me.  I am quite well; I am\\r\\nonly distressed by some dreadful news which I have just\\r\\nreceived from Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes\\r\\ncould not speak another word.  Darcy, in wretched suspense,\\r\\ncould only say something indistinctly of his concern, and\\r\\nobserve her in compassionate silence.  At length she spoke\\r\\nagain.  \"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful\\r\\nnews. It cannot be concealed from any one.  My younger sister\\r\\nhas left all her friends-- has eloped; has thrown herself into the\\r\\npower of-- of Mr. Wickham.  They are gone off together from\\r\\nBrighton.  YOU know him too well to doubt the rest.  She has\\r\\nno money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to-- she\\r\\nis lost for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment.  \"When I consider,\" she added\\r\\nin a yet more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it!\\r\\nI, who knew what he was.  Had I but explained some part of\\r\\nit only-- some part of what I learnt, to my own family!  Had his\\r\\ncharacter been known, this could not have happened.  But it is\\r\\nall-- all too late now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved-- shocked.  But is\\r\\nit certain-- absolutely certain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and\\r\\nwere traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are\\r\\ncertainly not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover\\r\\nher?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my\\r\\nuncle\\'s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in\\r\\nhalf-an-hour.  But nothing can be done-- I know very well that\\r\\nnothing can be done.  How is such a man to be worked on?\\r\\nHow are they even to be discovered?  I have not the smallest\\r\\nhope.  It is every way horrible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When MY eyes were opened to his real character-- Oh! had I\\r\\nknown what I ought, what I dared to do!  But I knew not-- I\\r\\nwas afraid of doing too much.  Wretched, wretched mistake!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and\\r\\nwas walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his\\r\\nbrow contracted, his air gloomy.  Elizabeth soon observed, and\\r\\ninstantly understood it.  Her power was sinking; everything\\r\\nMUST sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an\\r\\nassurance of the deepest disgrace.  She could neither wonder\\r\\nnor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\\r\\nto her consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her\\r\\ndistress.  It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her\\r\\nunderstand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt\\r\\nthat she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be\\r\\nvain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.  Lydia--\\r\\nthe humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon\\r\\nswallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her\\r\\nhandkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and,\\r\\nafter a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of\\r\\nher situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner\\r\\nwhich, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint,\\r\\nsaid, \"I am afraid you have been  long desiring my absence, nor\\r\\nhave I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though\\r\\nunavailing concern.  Would to Heaven that anything could be\\r\\neither said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\\r\\nsuch distress!  But I will not torment you with vain wishes,\\r\\nwhich may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.  This\\r\\nunfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister\\'s having the\\r\\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes.  Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.  Say\\r\\nthat urgent business calls us home immediately.  Conceal the\\r\\nunhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his\\r\\nsorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than\\r\\nthere was at present reason to hope, and leaving his\\r\\ncompliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting\\r\\nlook went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was\\r\\nthat they should ever see each other again on such terms of\\r\\ncordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire;\\r\\nand as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their\\r\\nacquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at\\r\\nthe perverseness of those feelings which would now have\\r\\npromoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in\\r\\nits termination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor\\r\\nfaulty.  But if otherwise-- if regard springing from such sources\\r\\nis unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often\\r\\ndescribed as arising on a first interview with its object, and even\\r\\nbefore two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in\\r\\nher defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the\\r\\nlatter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill\\r\\nsuccess might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less\\r\\ninteresting mode of attachment.  Be that as it may, she saw him\\r\\ngo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\\'s infamy\\r\\nmust produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that\\r\\nwretched business.  Never, since reading Jane\\'s second letter,\\r\\nhad she entertained a hope of Wickham\\'s meaning to marry her.\\r\\nNo one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an\\r\\nexpectation.  Surprise was the least of her feelings on this\\r\\ndevelopment.  While the contents of the first letter remained in\\r\\nher mind, she was all surprise-- all astonishment that Wickham\\r\\nshould marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for\\r\\nmoney; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had\\r\\nappeared incomprehensible.  But no it was all too natural. For\\r\\nsuch an attachment as this she might have sufficient charm; and\\r\\nthough she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in\\r\\nan elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her\\r\\nunderstanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in\\r\\nHertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was\\r\\nconvinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach\\r\\nherself to anybody.  Sometimes one officer, sometimes another,\\r\\nhad been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her\\r\\nopinion.  Her affections had continually been fluctuating but\\r\\nnever without an object.  The mischief of neglect and mistaken\\r\\nindulgence towards such a girl-- oh! how acutely did she now\\r\\nfeel it!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was wild to be at home-- to hear, to see, to be upon the\\r\\nspot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly\\r\\nupon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother\\r\\nincapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and\\r\\nthough almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia,\\r\\nher uncle\\'s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and\\r\\ntill he entered the room her impatience was severe.  Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the\\r\\nservant\\'s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\\r\\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated\\r\\nthe cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and\\r\\ndwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy,\\r\\nthough Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted.  Not Lydia\\r\\nonly, but all were concerned in it; and after the first\\r\\nexclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised\\r\\nevery assistance in his power.  Elizabeth, though expecting no\\r\\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being\\r\\nactuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was\\r\\nspeedily settled.  They were to be off as soon as possible.  \"But\\r\\nwhat is to be done about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it\\r\\nso?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our\\r\\nengagement.  THAT is all settled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her\\r\\nroom to prepare.  \"And are they upon such terms as for her to\\r\\ndisclose the real truth?  Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her\\r\\nin the hurry and confusion of the following hour.  Had Elizabeth\\r\\nbeen at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that\\r\\nall employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself;\\r\\nbut she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and\\r\\namongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their\\r\\nfriends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden\\r\\ndeparture.  An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and\\r\\nMr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn,\\r\\nnothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all\\r\\nthe misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of\\r\\ntime than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and\\r\\non the road to Longbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 47\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle,\\r\\nas they drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious\\r\\nconsideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\\r\\nyour eldest sister does on the matter.  It appears to me so very\\r\\nunlikely that any young man should form such a design against\\r\\na girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who\\r\\nwas actually staying in his colonel\\'s family, that I am strongly\\r\\ninclined to hope the best.  Could he expect that her friends\\r\\nwould not step forward?  Could he expect to be noticed again\\r\\nby the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?  His\\r\\ntemptation is not adequate to the risk!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your\\r\\nuncle\\'s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,\\r\\nhonour, and interest, for him to be guilty of.  I cannot think so\\r\\nvery ill of Wickham.  Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give\\r\\nhim up, as to believe him capable of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\r\\nneglect I can believe him capable.  If, indeed, it should be so!\\r\\nBut I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland\\r\\nif that had been the case?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute\\r\\nproof that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is\\r\\nsuch a presumption!  And, besides, no traces of them were to be\\r\\nfound on the Barnet road.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then-- supposing them to be in London.  They may be there,\\r\\nthough for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional\\r\\npurpose.  It is not likely that money should be very abundant on\\r\\neither side; and it might strike them that they could be more\\r\\neconomically, though less expeditiously, married in London\\r\\nthan in Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why all this secrecy?  Why any fear of detection?  Why must\\r\\ntheir marriage be private?  Oh, no, no-- this is not likely.  His\\r\\nmost particular friend, you see by Jane\\'s account, was\\r\\npersuaded of his never intending to marry her.  Wickham will\\r\\nnever marry a woman without some money.  He cannot afford\\r\\nit.  And what claims has Lydia-- what attraction has she beyond\\r\\nyouth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her\\r\\nsake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying\\r\\nwell?  As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the\\r\\ncorps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am\\r\\nnot able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a\\r\\nstep might produce.  But as to your other objection, I am afraid\\r\\nit will hardly hold good.  Lydia has no brothers to step forward;\\r\\nand he might imagine, from my father\\'s behaviour, from his\\r\\nindolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to\\r\\nwhat was going forward in his family, that HE would do as\\r\\nlittle, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such\\r\\na matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love\\r\\nof him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nwith tears in her eyes, \"that a sister\\'s sense of decency and\\r\\nvirtue in such a point should admit of doubt.  But, really, I\\r\\nknow not what to say.  Perhaps I am not doing her justice.  But\\r\\nshe is very young; she has never been taught to think on\\r\\nserious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a\\r\\ntwelvemonth-- she has been given up to nothing but amusement\\r\\nand vanity.  She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the\\r\\nmost idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that\\r\\ncame in her way.  Since the  ----shire were first quartered in\\r\\nMeryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in\\r\\nher head.  She has been doing everything in her power by\\r\\nthinking and talking on the subject, to give greater-- what shall\\r\\nI call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively\\r\\nenough.  And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\\r\\nperson and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so very\\r\\nill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?  And who is there, whatever\\r\\nmight be their former conduct, that she would think capable of\\r\\nsuch an attempt, till it were proved against them?  But Jane\\r\\nknows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.  We both know\\r\\nthat he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he\\r\\nhas neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful\\r\\nas he is insinuating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose\\r\\ncuriosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring.  \"I told you, the\\r\\nother day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you\\r\\nyourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he\\r\\nspoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and\\r\\nliberality towards him.  And there are other circumstances which\\r\\nI am not at liberty-- which it is not worth while to relate; but his\\r\\nlies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.  From what\\r\\nhe said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\\r\\nreserved, disagreeable girl.  Yet he knew to the contrary himself.\\r\\nHe must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we\\r\\nhave found her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this?  can she be ignorant of\\r\\nwhat you and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and\\r\\nsaw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.  And when I\\r\\nreturned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or\\r\\nfortnight\\'s time.  As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I\\r\\nrelated the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our\\r\\nknowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any\\r\\none, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of\\r\\nhim should then be overthrown?  And even when it was settled\\r\\nthat Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\\r\\nher eyes to his character never occurred to me.  That SHE could\\r\\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head.\\r\\nThat such a consequence as THIS could ensue, you may easily\\r\\nbelieve, was far enough from my thoughts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no\\r\\nreason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not the slightest.  I can remember no symptom of affection on\\r\\neither side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you\\r\\nmust be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be\\r\\nthrown away.  When first he entered the corps, she was ready\\r\\nenough to admire him; but so we all were.  Every girl in or near\\r\\nMeryton was out of her senses about him for the first two\\r\\nmonths; but he never distinguished HER by any particular\\r\\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of\\r\\nextravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way,\\r\\nand others of the regiment, who treated her with more\\r\\ndistinction, again became her favourites.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be\\r\\nadded to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting\\r\\nsubject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them\\r\\nfrom it long, during the whole of the journey.  From Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nthoughts it was never absent.  Fixed there by the keenest of all\\r\\nanguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or\\r\\nforgetfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one\\r\\nnight on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next\\r\\nday.  It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could\\r\\nnot have been wearied by long expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\\r\\nstanding on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;\\r\\nand, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise\\r\\nthat lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole\\r\\nbodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing\\r\\nearnest of their welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty\\r\\nkiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running\\r\\ndown from her mother\\'s apartment, immediately met her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled\\r\\nthe eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything\\r\\nhad been heard of the fugitives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane.  \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I\\r\\nhope everything will be well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is my father in town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have heard only twice.  He wrote me a few lines on\\r\\nWednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me\\r\\nhis directions, which I particularly begged him to do.  He merely\\r\\nadded that he should not write again till he had something of\\r\\nimportance to mention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my mother-- how is she?  How are you all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\\r\\ngreatly shaken.  She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction\\r\\nin seeing you all.  She does not yet leave her dressing-room.\\r\\nMary and Kitty are, thank Heaven, are quite well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you-- how are you?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"You look pale.\\r\\nHow much you must have gone through!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and\\r\\ntheir conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were engaged with their children,. Was now put an end\\r\\nto by the approach of the whole party.  Jane ran to her uncle and\\r\\naunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate\\r\\nsmiles and tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which\\r\\nElizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the\\r\\nothers, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to\\r\\ngive.  The sanguine hope of good, however, which the\\r\\nbenevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her;\\r\\nshe still expected that it would all end well, and that every\\r\\nmorning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her\\r\\nfather, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce\\r\\ntheir marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation together, received them exactly as might\\r\\nbe expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives\\r\\nagainst the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of\\r\\nher own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the\\r\\nperson to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her\\r\\ndaughter must principally be owing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going to\\r\\nBrighton, with all my family, THIS would not have happened;\\r\\nbut poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.  Why did\\r\\nthe Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?  I am sure there\\r\\nwas some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the\\r\\nkind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after.\\r\\nI always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her;\\r\\nbut I was overruled, as I always am.  Poor dear child!  And now\\r\\nhere\\'s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\\r\\nWickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and\\r\\nwhat is to become of us all?  The Collinses will turn us out\\r\\nbefore he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,\\r\\nbrother, I do not know what we shall do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,\\r\\nafter general assurances of his affection for her and all her\\r\\nfamily, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,\\r\\nand would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering\\r\\nLydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is\\r\\nright to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look\\r\\non it a certain.  It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.\\r\\nIn a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we\\r\\nknow that they are not married, and have no design of marrying,\\r\\ndo not let us give the matter over as lost.  As soon as I get to\\r\\ntown I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with\\r\\nme to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as\\r\\nto what is to be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly\\r\\nwhat I could most wish for.  And now do, when you get to\\r\\ntown, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not\\r\\nmarried already, MAKE them marry.  And as for wedding\\r\\nclothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall\\r\\nhave as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they\\r\\nare married.  And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\\r\\nTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out\\r\\nof my wits-- and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all\\r\\nover me-- such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and\\r\\nsuch beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.\\r\\nAnd tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her\\r\\nclothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are\\r\\nthe best warehouses.  Oh, brother, how kind you are!  I know\\r\\nyou will contrive it all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest\\r\\nendeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending\\r\\nmoderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after\\r\\ntalking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they\\r\\nall left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who\\r\\nattended in the absence of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no\\r\\nreal occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not\\r\\nattempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence\\r\\nenough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they\\r\\nwaited at table, and judged it better that ONE only of the\\r\\nhousehold, and the one whom they could most trust should\\r\\ncomprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty,\\r\\nwho had been  too busily engaged in their separate apartments\\r\\nto make their appearance before.  One came from her books,\\r\\nand the other from her toilette.  The faces of both, however,\\r\\nwere tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except\\r\\nthat the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had\\r\\nherself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness\\r\\nthan usual to the accents of Kitty.  As for Mary, she was\\r\\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a\\r\\ncountenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at\\r\\ntable:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much\\r\\ntalked of.  But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into\\r\\nthe wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly\\r\\nconsolation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she\\r\\nadded, \"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw\\r\\nfrom it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is\\r\\nirretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;\\r\\nthat her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that\\r\\nshe cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the\\r\\nundeserving of the other sex.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much\\r\\noppressed to make any reply.  Mary, however, continued to\\r\\nconsole herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil\\r\\nbefore them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\r\\nhalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed\\r\\nherself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane\\r\\nwas equally eager to satisfy.  After joining in general\\r\\nlamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which\\r\\nElizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could\\r\\nnot assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the\\r\\nsubject, by saying, \"But tell me all and everything about it which\\r\\nI have not already heard.  Give me further particulars.  What did\\r\\nColonel Forster say?  Had they no apprehension of anything\\r\\nbefore the elopement took place?  They must have seen them\\r\\ntogether for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\\r\\npartiality, especially on Lydia\\'s side, but nothing to give him any\\r\\nalarm.  I am so grieved for him!  His behaviour was attentive and\\r\\nkind to the utmost.  He WAS coming to us, in order to assure us\\r\\nof his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to\\r\\nScotland:  when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened\\r\\nhis journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?\\r\\nDid he know of their intending to go off?  Had Colonel Forster\\r\\nseen Denny himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but, when questioned by HIM, Denny denied knowing\\r\\nanything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion\\r\\nabout it.  He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\\r\\nmarrying-- and from THAT, I am inclined to hope, he might\\r\\nhave been misunderstood before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\\r\\nentertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?\\r\\nI felt a little uneasy-- a little fearful of my sister\\'s happiness with\\r\\nhim in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been\\r\\nalways quite right.  My father and mother knew nothing of that;\\r\\nthey only felt how imprudent a match it must be.  Kitty then\\r\\nowned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the\\r\\nrest of us, that in Lydia\\'s last letter she had prepared her for\\r\\nsuch a step.  She had known, it seems, of their being in love with\\r\\neach other, many weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I believe not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham\\r\\nhimself?  Does he know he real character?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he\\r\\nformerly did.  He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\\r\\nAnd since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left\\r\\nMeryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew\\r\\nof him, this could not have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister.  \"But to\\r\\nexpose the former faults of any person without knowing what\\r\\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.  We acted with\\r\\nthe best intentions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\\'s note to\\r\\nhis wife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\\r\\nThese were the contents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR HARRIET,--\\r\\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot\\r\\nhelp laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as\\r\\nsoon as I am missed.  I am going to Gretna Green, and if you\\r\\ncannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there\\r\\nis but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.  I should\\r\\nnever be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.  You\\r\\nneed not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do\\r\\nnot like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write\\r\\nto them and sign my name \\'Lydia Wickham.\\'  What a good joke\\r\\nit will be!  I can hardly write for laughing.  Pray make my\\r\\nexcuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing\\r\\nwith him to-night.  Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he\\r\\nknows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we\\r\\nmeet, with great pleasure.  I shall send for my clothes when I\\r\\nget to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a\\r\\ngreat slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.\\r\\nGood-bye.  Give my love to Colonel Forster.  I hope you will\\r\\ndrink to our good journey.  Your affectionate friend,\\r\\n                              \"Lydia Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she\\r\\nhad finished it.  What a letter is this, to be written at such a\\r\\nmoment!  But at least it shows that SHE was serious on the\\r\\nsubject of their journey.  Whatever he might afterwards\\r\\npersuade her to, it was not on her side a SCHEME of\\r\\ninfamy.  My poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI never saw any one so shocked.  He could not speak a word\\r\\nfor full ten minutes.  My mother was taken ill immediately, and\\r\\nthe whole house in such confusion!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it\\r\\nwho did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  I hope there was.  But to be guarded at such a\\r\\ntime is very difficult.  My mother was in hysterics, and though I\\r\\nendeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am\\r\\nafraid I did not do so much as I might have done!  But the\\r\\nhorror of what might possibly happen almost took from me\\r\\nmy faculties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.  You do\\r\\nnot look well.  Oh that I had been with you!  you have had every\\r\\ncare and anxiety upon yourself alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in\\r\\nevery fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of\\r\\nthem.  Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,\\r\\nthat her hours of repose should not be broken in on.  My aunt\\r\\nPhillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went\\r\\naway; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.  She\\r\\nwas of great use and comfort to us all.  And Lady Lucas has\\r\\nbeen very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\\r\\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her\\r\\ndaughters\\', if they should be of use to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth; \"perhaps\\r\\nshe MEANT well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one\\r\\ncannot see too little of one\\'s neighbours.  Assistance is\\r\\nimpossible; condolence insufferable.  Let them triumph over us\\r\\nat a distance, and be satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her\\r\\nfather had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of\\r\\nhis daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He meant I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place\\r\\nwhere they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if\\r\\nanything could be made out from them.  His principal object\\r\\nmust be to discover the number of the hackney coach which\\r\\ntook them from Clapham.  It had come with a fare from\\r\\nLondon; and as he thought that the circumstance of a\\r\\ngentleman and lady\\'s removing from one carriage into another\\r\\nmight be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham.  If\\r\\nhe could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had\\r\\nbefore set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there,\\r\\nand hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and\\r\\nnumber of the coach.  I do not know of any other designs that\\r\\nhe had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his\\r\\nspirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\\r\\nout even so much as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 48\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the\\r\\nnext morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line\\r\\nfrom him.  His family knew him to be, on all common occasions,\\r\\na most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time\\r\\nthey had hoped for exertion.  They were forced to conclude that\\r\\nhe had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of THAT they\\r\\nwould have been glad to be certain.  Mr. Gardiner had waited\\r\\nonly for the letters before he set off.\\r\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving\\r\\nconstant information of what was going on, and their uncle\\r\\npromised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\\r\\nLongbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his\\r\\nsister, who considered it as the only security for her husband\\'s\\r\\nnot being killed in a duel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire\\r\\na few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be\\r\\nserviceable to her nieces.  She shared in their attendance on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of\\r\\nfreedom.  Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and\\r\\nalways, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening\\r\\nthem up-- though, as she never came without reporting some\\r\\nfresh instance of Wickham\\'s extravagance or irregularity, she\\r\\nseldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than\\r\\nshe found them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three\\r\\nmonths before, had been almost an angel of light.  He was\\r\\ndeclared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his\\r\\nintrigues all honoured with the title of seduction, had been\\r\\nextended into every tradesman\\'s family.  Everybody declared\\r\\nthat he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\\r\\neverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted\\r\\nthe appearance of his goodness.  Elizabeth, though she did not\\r\\ncredit above half of what was said, believed enough to make\\r\\nher former assurance of her sister\\'s ruin more certain; and even\\r\\nJane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more\\r\\nespecially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to\\r\\nScotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they\\r\\nmust in all probability have gained some news of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife\\r\\nreceived a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he\\r\\nhad immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to\\r\\ncome to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to\\r\\nEpsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining\\r\\nany satisfactory information; and that he was now determined\\r\\nto inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\\r\\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on\\r\\ntheir first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.\\r\\nMr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this\\r\\nmeasure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist\\r\\nhim in pursuing it.  He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly\\r\\ndisinclined at present to leave London and promised to write\\r\\nagain very soon.  There was also a postscript to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\r\\npossible, from some of the young man\\'s intimates in the\\r\\nregiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections\\r\\nwho would be likely to know in what part of town he has now\\r\\nconcealed himself.  If there were any one that one could apply\\r\\nto with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be\\r\\nof essential consequence.  At present we have nothing to guide\\r\\nus.  Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power\\r\\nto satisfy us on this head.  But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\\r\\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than\\r\\nany other person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this\\r\\ndeference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her\\r\\npower to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the\\r\\ncompliment deserved.  She had never heard of his having had\\r\\nany relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had\\r\\nbeen dead many years.  It was possible, however, that some of\\r\\nhis companions in the ----shire might be able to give more\\r\\ninformation; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\\r\\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most\\r\\nanxious part of each was when the post was expected.  The\\r\\narrival of letters was the grand object of every morning\\'s\\r\\nimpatience.  Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be\\r\\ntold would be communicated, and every succeeding day was\\r\\nexpected to bring some news of importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived\\r\\nfor their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;\\r\\nwhich, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for\\r\\nhim in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who\\r\\nknew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her,\\r\\nand read it likewise. It was s follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--\\r\\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in\\r\\nlife, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\\r\\nsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\\r\\nfrom Hertfordshire.  Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins\\r\\nand myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your\\r\\nrespectable family, in your present distress, which must be of\\r\\nthe bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no\\r\\n time can remove.  No arguments shall be wanting on my part\\r\\nthat can alleviate so severe a misfortune-- or that may comfort\\r\\nyou, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most\\r\\nafflicting to a parent\\'s mind.  The death of your daughter would\\r\\nhave been a blessing in comparison of  this.  And it is the more\\r\\nto be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear\\r\\nCharlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in\\r\\nyour daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;\\r\\nthough, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition\\r\\nmust be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an\\r\\nenormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are\\r\\ngrievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by\\r\\nMrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter,\\r\\nto whom I have related the affair.  They agree with me in\\r\\napprehending that this false step in one daughter will be\\r\\ninjurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves\\r\\nwith such a family?  And this consideration leads me moreover\\r\\nto reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last\\r\\nNovember; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\\r\\nin all your sorrow and disgrace.  Let me then advise you, dear\\r\\nsir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your\\r\\nunworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\\r\\nreap the fruits of her own heinous offense.-- I am, dear sir, etc.,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer\\r\\nfrom Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant\\r\\nnature to send.  It was not known that Wickham had a single\\r\\nrelationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was\\r\\ncertain that he had no  near one living.  His former\\r\\nacquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the\\r\\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular\\r\\nfriendship with any of them.  There was no one, therefore, who\\r\\ncould be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.  And in\\r\\nthe wretched state of his own finances, there was a very\\r\\npowerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery\\r\\nby Lydia\\'s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left\\r\\ngaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\\r\\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.  He owed\\r\\na good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\\r\\nformidable.  Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these\\r\\nparticulars from the Longbourn family.  Jane heard them with\\r\\nhorror.  \"A gamester!\" she cried.  \"This is wholly unexpected.\\r\\nI had not an idea of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see\\r\\ntheir father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\\r\\nRendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he\\r\\nhad yielded to his brother-in-law\\'s entreaty that he would return\\r\\nto his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might\\r\\nsuggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.  When Mrs.\\r\\nBennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction\\r\\nas her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his\\r\\nlife had been before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\" she cried.\\r\\n\"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.  Who\\r\\nis to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes\\r\\naway?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled\\r\\nthat she and the children should go to London, at the same time\\r\\nthat Mr. Bennet came from it.  The coach, therefore, took them\\r\\nthe first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to\\r\\nLongbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth\\r\\nand her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part\\r\\nof the world.  His name had never been voluntarily mentioned\\r\\nbefore them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter\\r\\nfrom him, had ended in nothing.  Elizabeth had received none\\r\\nsince her return that could come from Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other\\r\\nexcuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing,\\r\\ntherefore, could be fairly conjectured from THAT, though\\r\\nElizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with\\r\\nher own feelings, was perfectly  aware that, had she known\\r\\nnothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia\\'s\\r\\ninfamy somewhat better.  It would have spared her, she thought,\\r\\none sleepless night out of two.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\r\\nphilosophic composure.  He said as little as he had ever been in\\r\\nthe habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had\\r\\ntaken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had\\r\\ncourage to speak of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,\\r\\nthat Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on\\r\\nher briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have\\r\\nendured, he replied, \"Say nothing of that.  Who should suffer\\r\\nbut myself?  It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well warn me against such an evil.  Human nature is\\r\\nso prone to fall into it!  No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel\\r\\nhow much I have been to blame.  I am not afraid of being\\r\\noverpowered by the impression.  It will pass away soon enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is happy then,\" said her father drily; \"and her residence\\r\\nthere will probably be of some duration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen after a short silence he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to\\r\\nme last May, which, considering the event, shows some\\r\\ngreatness of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her\\r\\nmother\\'s tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a parade,\" he cried, \"which does one good; it gives such\\r\\nan elegance to misfortune!  Another day I will do the same; I\\r\\nwill sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and\\r\\ngive as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till\\r\\nKitty runs away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not going to run away, papa,\" said Kitty fretfully.  \"If I\\r\\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU go to Brighton.  I would not trust you so near it as\\r\\nEastbourne for fifty pounds!  No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to\\r\\nbe cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.  No officer is ever\\r\\nto enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the\\r\\nvillage.  Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up\\r\\nwith one of your sisters.  And you are never to stir out of doors\\r\\ntill you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day\\r\\nin a rational manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy.  If you\\r\\nare a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review\\r\\nat the end of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 49\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet\\'s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were\\r\\nwalking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw\\r\\nthe housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she\\r\\ncame to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her;\\r\\nbut, instead of the expected summons, when they approached\\r\\nher, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon, madam, for\\r\\ninterrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\\r\\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Hill?  We have heard nothing from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \"don\\'t\\r\\nyou know there is an express come for master from Mr.\\r\\nGardiner?  He has been here this half-hour, and master has had\\r\\na letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\\r\\nThey ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from\\r\\nthence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were\\r\\non the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when\\r\\nthey were met by the butler, who said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma\\'am, he is walking\\r\\ntowards the little copse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall\\r\\nonce more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was\\r\\ndeliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side\\r\\nof the paddock.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running\\r\\nas Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for\\r\\nbreath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, papa, what news-- what news?  Have you heard from my\\r\\nuncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and what news does it bring-- good or bad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the\\r\\nletter from his pocket.  \"But perhaps you would like to read it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.  Jane now came\\r\\nup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know myself what\\r\\nit is about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                    \"Gracechurch Street, Monday,\"\\r\\n                              \"August 2.\\r\\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,--\\r\\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and\\r\\nsuch as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction.\\r\\nSoon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to\\r\\nfind out in what part of London they were.  The particulars I\\r\\nreserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.\\r\\nI have seen them both-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then it is as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are married!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth read on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen them both.  They are not married, nor can I find\\r\\nthere was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to\\r\\nperform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\\r\\nyour side, I hope it will not be long before they are.  All that is\\r\\nrequired of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\\r\\nequal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your\\r\\nchildren after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\\r\\nmoreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during\\r\\nyour life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\\r\\nwhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying\\r\\nwith, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.  I shall send\\r\\nthis by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your\\r\\nanswer.  You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,\\r\\nthat Mr. Wickham\\'s circumstances are not so hopeless as they\\r\\nare generally believed to be.  The world has been deceived in\\r\\nthat respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little\\r\\nmoney, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my\\r\\nniece, in addition to her own fortune.  If, as I conclude will be\\r\\nthe case, you send me full powers to act in your name\\r\\nthroughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give\\r\\ndirections to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.\\r\\nThere will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town\\r\\nagain; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my\\r\\ndiligence and care.  Send back your answer as fast as you can,\\r\\nand be careful to write explicitly.  We have judged it best that\\r\\nmy niece should be married from this house, of which I hope\\r\\nyou will approve.  She comes to us to-day.  I shall write again as\\r\\nsoon as anything more is determined on.  Yours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"EDW. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it possible?\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.  \"Can it\\r\\nbe possible that he will marry her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\" said\\r\\nher sister.  \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" cried Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMost earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time\\r\\nbefore he wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back and write\\r\\nimmediately.  Consider how important every moment is in such\\r\\na case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the trouble\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards\\r\\nthe house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And may I ask--\" said Elizabeth; \"but the terms, I suppose,\\r\\nmust be complied with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Complied with!  I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they MUST marry!  Yet he is SUCH a man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry.  There is nothing else to be done.\\r\\nBut there are two things that I want very much to know; one is,\\r\\nhow much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about;\\r\\nand the other, how am I ever to pay him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Money!  My uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so\\r\\nslight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and\\r\\nfifty after I am gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred\\r\\nto me before.  His debts to be discharged, and something still to\\r\\nremain!  Oh! it must be my uncle\\'s doings!  Generous, good\\r\\nman, I am afraid he has distressed himself.  A small sum could\\r\\nnot do all this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said her father; \"Wickham\\'s a fool if he takes her with a\\r\\nfarthing less than ten thousand pounds.  I should be sorry to\\r\\nthink so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten thousand pounds!  Heaven forbid!  How is half such a\\r\\nsum to be repaid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,\\r\\ncontinued silent till they reached the house.  Their father then\\r\\nwent on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the\\r\\nbreakfast-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as soon\\r\\nas they were by themselves.  \"How strange this is!  And for\\r\\nTHIS we are to be thankful.  That they should marry, small as\\r\\nis their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character,\\r\\nwe are forced to rejoice.  Oh, Lydia!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly\\r\\nwould not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.\\r\\nThough our kind uncle has done something towards clearing\\r\\nhim, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like\\r\\nit, has been advanced.  He has children of his own, and may\\r\\nhave more.  How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham\\'s debts have been,\"\\r\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our\\r\\nsister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for\\r\\nthem, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.  The\\r\\nkindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.  Their\\r\\ntaking her home, and affording her their personal protection and\\r\\ncountenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of\\r\\ngratitude cannot enough acknowledge.  By this time she is\\r\\nactually with them!  If such goodness does not make her\\r\\nmiserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!  What a\\r\\nmeeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\"\\r\\nsaid Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy.  His\\r\\nconsenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come\\r\\nto a right way of thinking.  Their mutual affection will steady\\r\\nthem; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in\\r\\nso rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence\\r\\nforgotten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as neither\\r\\nyou, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.  It is useless to talk of\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all\\r\\nlikelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.  They went\\r\\nto the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would\\r\\nnot wish them to make it known to her.  He was writing and,\\r\\nwithout raising his head, coolly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May we take my uncle\\'s letter to read to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went\\r\\nupstairs together.  Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:\\r\\none communication would, therefore, do for all.  After a slight\\r\\npreparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet could hardly contain herself.  As soon as Jane had read\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s hope of Lydia\\'s  being soon married, her joy\\r\\nburst forth, and every following sentence added to its\\r\\nexuberance.  She was now in an irritation as violent from\\r\\ndelight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.\\r\\nTo know that her daughter would be married was enough.  She\\r\\nwas disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any\\r\\nremembrance of her misconduct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried.  \"This is delightful indeed!\\r\\nShe will be married!  I shall see her again!  She will be married at\\r\\nsixteen!  My good, kind brother!  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nknew he would manage everything!  How I long to see her!  and\\r\\nto see dear Wickham too!  But the clothes, the wedding clothes!\\r\\nI will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.  Lizzy,\\r\\nmy dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will\\r\\ngive her.  Stay, stay, I will go myself.  Ring the bell, Kitty, for\\r\\nHill.  I will put on my things in a moment.  My dear, dear Lydia!\\r\\nHow merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the\\r\\nviolence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the\\r\\nobligations which Mr. Gardiner\\'s behaviour laid them all under.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a\\r\\ngreat measure to his kindness.  We are persuaded that he has\\r\\npledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it\\r\\nbut her own uncle?  If he had not had a family of his own, I and\\r\\nmy children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the\\r\\nfirst time we have ever had anything from him, except a few\\r\\npresents.  Well!  I am so happy!  In a short time I shall have a\\r\\ndaughter married.  Mrs. Wickham!  How well it sounds!  And\\r\\nshe was only sixteen last June.  My dear Jane, I am in such a\\r\\nflutter, that I am sure I can\\'t write; so I will dictate, and you\\r\\nwrite for me.  We will settle with your father about the money\\r\\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,\\r\\nand cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very\\r\\nplentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty,\\r\\npersuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be\\r\\nconsulted.  One day\\'s delay, she observed, would be of small\\r\\nimportance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so\\r\\nobstinate as usual.  Other schemes, too, came into her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and\\r\\ntell the good, good news to my sister Philips.  And as I come\\r\\nback, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.  Kitty, run down\\r\\nand order the carriage.  An airing would do me a great deal of\\r\\ngood, I am sure.  Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?\\r\\nOh!  Here comes Hill!  My dear Hill, have you heard the good\\r\\nnews?  Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have\\r\\na bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.  Elizabeth received\\r\\nher congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly,\\r\\ntook refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Lydia\\'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it\\r\\nwas no worse, she had need to be thankful.  She felt it so; and\\r\\nthough, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor\\r\\nworldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in\\r\\nlooking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she\\r\\nfelt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 50\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life\\r\\nthat, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an\\r\\nannual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his\\r\\nwife, if she survived him.  He now wished it more than ever.\\r\\nHad he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been\\r\\nindebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could\\r\\nnow be purchased for her.  The satisfaction of prevailing on one\\r\\nof the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her\\r\\nhusband might then have rested in its proper place.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to\\r\\nanyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his\\r\\nbrother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out\\r\\nthe extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as\\r\\nsoon as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be\\r\\nperfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.  The\\r\\nson was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be\\r\\nof age, and the widow and younger children would by that\\r\\nmeans be provided for.  Five daughters successively entered the\\r\\nworld, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many\\r\\nyears after Lydia\\'s birth, had been certain that he would.  This\\r\\nevent had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be\\r\\nsaving.  Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\\r\\nhusband\\'s love of independence had alone prevented their\\r\\nexceeding their income.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet and the children.  But in what proportions it should be\\r\\ndivided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\\r\\nThis was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was\\r\\nnow to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in\\r\\nacceding to the proposal before him.  In terms of grateful\\r\\nacknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\\r\\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\r\\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\\r\\nengagements that had been made for him.  He had never before\\r\\nsupposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his\\r\\ndaughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to\\r\\nhimself as by the present arrangement.  He would scarcely be\\r\\nten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid\\r\\nthem; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the\\r\\ncontinual presents in money which passed to her through her\\r\\nmother\\'s hands, Lydia\\'s expenses had been very little within\\r\\nthat sum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,\\r\\ntoo, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present\\r\\nwas to have as little trouble in the business as possible.  When\\r\\nthe first transports of rage which had produced his activity in\\r\\nseeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former\\r\\nindolence.  His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory\\r\\nin undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.  He\\r\\nbegged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to\\r\\nhis brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message\\r\\nto her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with\\r\\nproportionate speed through the neighbourhood.  It was borne\\r\\nin the latter with decent philosophy.  To be sure, it would have\\r\\nbeen more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia\\r\\nBennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative,\\r\\nbeen secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse.  But\\r\\nthere was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\\r\\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded\\r\\nbefore from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little\\r\\nof their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such\\r\\nan husband her misery was considered certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on\\r\\nthis happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,\\r\\nand in spirits oppressively high.  No sentiment of shame gave a\\r\\ndamp to her triumph.  The marriage of a daughter, which had\\r\\nbeen the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was\\r\\nnow on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her\\r\\nwords ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine\\r\\nmuslins, new carriages, and servants.  She was busily searching\\r\\nthrough the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her\\r\\ndaughter, and, without knowing of considering what their\\r\\nincome might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could quit it--\\r\\nor the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;\\r\\nbut Ashworth is too far off!  I could not bear to have her ten\\r\\nmiles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while\\r\\nthe servants remained.  But when they had withdrawn, he said\\r\\nto her: \"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses\\r\\nfor your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.\\r\\nInto ONE house in this neighbourhood they shall never have\\r\\nadmittance.  I will not encourage the impudence of either, by\\r\\nreceiving them at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was\\r\\nfirm.  It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\\r\\namazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a\\r\\nguinea to buy clothes for his daughter.  He protested that she\\r\\nshould receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the\\r\\noccasion.  Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it.  That his\\r\\nanger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\\r\\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which\\r\\nher marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could\\r\\nbelieve possible.  She was more alive to the disgrace which her\\r\\nwant of new clothes must reflect on her daughter\\'s nuptials, than\\r\\nto any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a\\r\\nfortnight before they took place.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the\\r\\ndistress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted\\r\\nwith their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would\\r\\nso shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they\\r\\nmight hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those\\r\\nwho were not immediately on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.\\r\\nThere were few people on whose secrecy she would have more\\r\\nconfidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one\\r\\nwhose knowledge of a sister\\'s frailty would have mortified her\\r\\nso much-- not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it\\r\\nindividually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf\\r\\nimpassable between them.  Had Lydia\\'s marriage been\\r\\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be\\r\\nsupposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family\\r\\nwhere, to every other objection, would now be added an\\r\\nalliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom\\r\\nhe so justly scorned.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From such a connection she could not wonder that he would\\r\\nshrink.  The wish of procuring her regard, which she had\\r\\nassured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational\\r\\nexpectation survive such a blow as this.  She was humbled, she\\r\\nwas grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.\\r\\nShe became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer\\r\\nhope to be benefited by it.  She wanted to hear of him, when\\r\\nthere seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.  She was\\r\\nconvinced that she could have been happy with him, when it\\r\\nwas no longer likely they should meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know\\r\\nthat the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four\\r\\nmonths ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully\\r\\nreceived!  He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most\\r\\ngenerous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a\\r\\ntriumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man\\r\\nwho, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have\\r\\nanswered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to\\r\\nthe advantage of both: by her ease and liveliness, his mind might\\r\\nhave been softened, his manners improved; and from his\\r\\njudgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\\r\\nhave received benefit of greater importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring\\r\\nmultitude what connubial felicity really was.  An union of a\\r\\ndifferent tendency ,and precluding the possibility of the other,\\r\\nwas soon to be formed in their family.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\\r\\nindependence, she could not imagine.  But how little of\\r\\npermanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only\\r\\nbrought together because their passions were stronger than their\\r\\nvirtue, she could easily conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.  To Mr. Bennet\\'s\\r\\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his\\r\\neagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and\\r\\nconcluded with entreaties that the subject might never be\\r\\nmentioned to him again.  The principal purport of his letter was\\r\\nto inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the\\r\\nmilitia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added, \"as\\r\\nsoon as his marriage was fixed on.  And I think you will agree\\r\\nwith me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly\\r\\nadvisable, both on his account and my niece\\'s.  It is Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s intention to go into the regulars; and among his\\r\\nformer friends, there are still some who are able and willing to\\r\\nassist him in the army.  He has the promise of an ensigncy in\\r\\nGeneral ----\\'s regiment, now quartered in the North.  It is an\\r\\nadvantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.  He\\r\\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they\\r\\nmay each have a character to preserve, they will both be more\\r\\nprudent.  I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our\\r\\npresent arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the\\r\\nvarious creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with\\r\\nassurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.\\r\\nAnd will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar\\r\\nassurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a\\r\\nlist according to his information?  He has given in all his debts; I\\r\\nhope at least he has not deceived us.  Haggerston has our\\r\\ndirections, and all will be completed in a week.  They will then\\r\\njoin his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and\\r\\nI understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous\\r\\nof seeing you all before she leaves the South.  She is well, and\\r\\nbegs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.--\\r\\nYours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"E. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of\\r\\nWickham\\'s removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr.\\r\\nGardiner could do.  But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased\\r\\nwith it.  Lydia\\'s being settled in the North, just when she had\\r\\nexpected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had\\r\\nby no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nwas a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity\\r\\nthat Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was\\r\\nacquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster, \"said she, \"it will be quite\\r\\nshocking to send her away!  And there are several of the young\\r\\nmen, too, that she likes very much.  The officers may not be so\\r\\npleasant in General ----\\'s regiment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis daughter\\'s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\r\\nadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\\r\\nreceived at first an absolute negative.  But Jane and Elizabeth,\\r\\nwho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\\'s feelings and\\r\\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her\\r\\nparents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly,\\r\\nto receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they\\r\\nwere married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought,\\r\\nand act as they wished.  And their mother had the satisfaction\\r\\nof knowing that she would be able to show her married\\r\\ndaughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the\\r\\nNorth.  When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,\\r\\nhe sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that\\r\\nas soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to\\r\\nLongbourn.  Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham\\r\\nshould consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only\\r\\nher own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the\\r\\nlast object of her wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 51\\r\\n\\r\\nTHEIR sister\\'s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt\\r\\nfor her probably more than she felt for herself.  The carriage\\r\\nwas sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by\\r\\ndinner-time.  Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss\\r\\nBennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings\\r\\nwhich would have attended herself, had she been the culprit,\\r\\nand was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came.  The family were assembled in the breakfast room to\\r\\nreceive them.  Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the\\r\\ncarriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably\\r\\ngrave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown\\r\\nopen, and she ran into the room.  Her mother stepped forwards,\\r\\nembraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand,\\r\\nwith an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady;\\r\\nand wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt\\r\\nof their happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned,\\r\\nwas not quite so cordial.  His countenance rather gained in\\r\\nausterity; and he scarcely opened his lips.  The easy\\r\\nassurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke\\r\\nhim.  Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was\\r\\nshocked.  Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild,\\r\\nnoisy, and fearless.  She turned from sister to sister,\\r\\ndemanding their congratulations; and when at length they all\\r\\nsat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some\\r\\nlittle alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it\\r\\nwas a great while since she had been there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his\\r\\nmanners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his\\r\\nmarriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy\\r\\naddress, while he claimed their relationship, would have\\r\\ndelighted them all.  Elizabeth had not before believed him\\r\\nquite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving\\r\\nwithin herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of\\r\\nan impudent man.  She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\\r\\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no\\r\\nvariation of colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no want of discourse.  The bride and her mother could\\r\\nneither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to\\r\\nsit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in\\r\\nthat neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt\\r\\nvery unable to equal in her replies.  They seemed each of them\\r\\nto have the happiest memories in the world.  Nothing of the\\r\\npast was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to\\r\\nsubjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I\\r\\nwent away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there\\r\\nhave been things enough happened in the time.  Good gracious!\\r\\nwhen I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married\\r\\ntill I came back again!  though I thought it would be very good\\r\\nfun if I was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father lifted up his eyes.  Jane was distressed.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlooked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw\\r\\nany thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,\\r\\n\"Oh!  mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married\\r\\nto-day?  I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William\\r\\nGoulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know\\r\\nit, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off\\r\\nmy glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so\\r\\nthat he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like\\r\\nany thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer.  She got up, and ran out of\\r\\nthe room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing\\r\\nthrough the hall to the dining parlour.  She then joined them\\r\\nsoon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her\\r\\nmother\\'s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,\\r\\n\"Ah!  Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower,\\r\\nbecause I am a married woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that\\r\\nembarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\\r\\nHer ease and good spirits increased.  She longed to see Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to\\r\\nhear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\" by each of them; and in the\\r\\nmean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring, and boast of\\r\\nbeing married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the\\r\\nbreakfast room, \"and what do you think of my husband?  Is not\\r\\nhe a charming man?  I am sure my sisters must all envy me.  I\\r\\nonly hope they may have half my good luck.  They must all go to\\r\\nBrighton.  That is the place to get husbands.  What a pity it\\r\\nis, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.  But my dear\\r\\nLydia, I don\\'t at all like your going such a way off.  Must it\\r\\nbe so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  yes; -- there is nothing in that.  I shall like it\\r\\nof all things.  You and papa, and my sisters, must come down\\r\\nand see us.  We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I\\r\\ndare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get\\r\\ngood partners for them all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like it beyond any thing!\" said her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my\\r\\nsisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for\\r\\nthem before the winter is over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.\\r\\nMr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London,\\r\\nand he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so\\r\\nshort; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with\\r\\nher daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.  These\\r\\nparties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was\\r\\neven more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had\\r\\nexpected to find it; not equal to Lydia\\'s for him.  She had\\r\\nscarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from\\r\\nthe reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on\\r\\nby the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would\\r\\nhave wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose\\r\\nto elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his\\r\\nflight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\\r\\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an\\r\\nopportunity of having a companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him.  He was her dear Wickham on\\r\\nevery occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.\\r\\nHe did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would\\r\\nkill more birds on the first of September, than any body else\\r\\nin the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with\\r\\nher two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe.\\r\\nYou were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\\r\\nAre not you curious to hear how it was managed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too\\r\\nlittle said on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!  You are so strange!  But I must tell you how it went off.\\r\\nWe were married, you know, at St. Clement\\'s, because Wickham\\'s\\r\\nlodgings were in that parish.  And it was settled that we\\r\\nshould all be there by eleven o\\'clock.  My uncle and aunt and I\\r\\nwere to go together; and the others were to meet us at the\\r\\nchurch.  Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!\\r\\nI was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put\\r\\nit off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.  And\\r\\nthere was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and\\r\\ntalking away just as if she was reading a sermon.  However, I\\r\\ndid not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may\\r\\nsuppose, of my dear Wickham.  I longed to know whether he would\\r\\nbe married in his blue coat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it\\r\\nwould never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand,\\r\\nthat my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I\\r\\nwas with them.  If you\\'ll believe me, I did not once put my\\r\\nfoot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.  Not one\\r\\nparty, or scheme, or any thing.  To be sure London was rather\\r\\nthin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.  Well, and so\\r\\njust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away\\r\\nupon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.  And then, you\\r\\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it.\\r\\nWell, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my\\r\\nuncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we\\r\\ncould not be married all day.  But, luckily, he came back again\\r\\nin ten minutes\\' time, and then we all set out.  However, I\\r\\nrecollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going,\\r\\nthe wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done\\r\\nas well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! -- he was to come there with Wickham, you know, But\\r\\ngracious me!  I quite forgot!  I ought not to have said a word\\r\\nabout it.  I promised them so faithfully!  What will Wickham\\r\\nsay?  It was to be such a secret!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on\\r\\nthe subject.  You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with\\r\\ncuriosity; \"we will ask you no questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly\\r\\ntell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it\\r\\nout of her power, by running away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at\\r\\nleast it was impossible not to try for information.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad been at her sister\\'s wedding.  It was exactly a scene, and\\r\\nexactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and\\r\\nleast temptation to go.  Conjectures as to the meaning of it,\\r\\nrapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied\\r\\nwith none.  Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct\\r\\nin the noblest light, seemed most improbable.  She could not\\r\\nbear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote\\r\\na short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\\r\\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which\\r\\nhad been intended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity\\r\\nmust be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and\\r\\n(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have\\r\\nbeen amongst you at such a time.  Pray write instantly, and let\\r\\nme understand it -- unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to\\r\\nremain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and\\r\\nthen I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not that I shall, though,\" she added to herself, as she\\r\\nfinished the letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me\\r\\nin an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks\\r\\nand stratagems to find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane\\'s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\r\\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was\\r\\nglad of it; -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would\\r\\nreceive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a\\r\\nconfidante.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 52\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her\\r\\nletter as soon as she possibly could.  She was no sooner in\\r\\npossession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where\\r\\nshe was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of\\r\\nthe benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the\\r\\nletter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR NIECE,\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\\r\\nmorning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing\\r\\nwill not comprise what I have to tell you.  I must confess\\r\\nmyself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from\\r\\nyou.  Don\\'t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let\\r\\nyou know that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary\\r\\non your side.  If you do not choose to understand me, forgive\\r\\nmy impertinence.  Your uncle is as much surprised as I am --\\r\\nand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned\\r\\nwould have allowed him to act as he has done.  But if you are\\r\\nreally innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.  On the\\r\\nvery day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a\\r\\nmost unexpected visitor.  Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up\\r\\nwith him several hours.  It was all over before I arrived; so\\r\\nmy curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your\\'s seems to\\r\\nhave been.  He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out\\r\\nwhere your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen\\r\\nand talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\\r\\nFrom what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\\r\\nourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\\r\\nthem.  The motive professed was his conviction of its being\\r\\nowing to himself that Wickham\\'s worthlessness had not been so\\r\\nwell known as to make it impossible for any young woman of\\r\\ncharacter to love or confide in him.  He generously imputed the\\r\\nwhole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before\\r\\nthought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the\\r\\nworld.  His character was to speak for itself.  He called it,\\r\\ntherefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an\\r\\nevil which had been brought on by himself.  If he had\\r\\nanother motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.  He\\r\\nhad been some days in town, before he was able to discover\\r\\nthem; but he had something to direct his search, which was more\\r\\nthan we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason\\r\\nfor his resolving to follow us.  There is a lady, it seems, a\\r\\nMrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and\\r\\nwas dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation,\\r\\nthough he did not say what.  She then took a large house in\\r\\nEdward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\\r\\nlodgings.  This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted\\r\\nwith Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as\\r\\nsoon as he got to town.  But it was two or three days before he\\r\\ncould get from her what he wanted.  She would not betray her\\r\\ntrust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she\\r\\nreally did know where her friend was to be found.  Wickham\\r\\nindeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and\\r\\nhad she been able to receive them into her house, they would\\r\\nhave taken up their abode with her.  At length, however, our\\r\\nkind friend procured the wished-for direction.  They were in\\r\\n---- street.  He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing\\r\\nLydia.  His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to\\r\\npersuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and\\r\\nreturn to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to\\r\\nreceive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.\\r\\nBut he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she\\r\\nwas.  She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of\\r\\nhis; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.  She was sure they\\r\\nshould be married some time or other, and it did not much\\r\\nsignify when.  Since such were her feelings, it only remained,\\r\\nhe thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his\\r\\nvery first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had\\r\\nnever been his design.  He confessed himself obliged to leave\\r\\nthe regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were\\r\\nvery pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences\\r\\nof Lydia\\'s flight on her own folly alone.  He meant to resign\\r\\nhis commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he\\r\\ncould conjecture very little about it.  He must go somewhere,\\r\\nbut he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing\\r\\nto live on.  Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your\\r\\nsister at once.  Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very\\r\\nrich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his\\r\\nsituation must have been benefited by marriage.  But he found,\\r\\nin reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the\\r\\nhope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some\\r\\nother country.  Under such circumstances, however, he was not\\r\\nlikely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\\r\\nThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\\r\\nWickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length\\r\\nwas reduced to be reasonable.  Every thing being settled\\r\\nbetween them, Mr. Darcy\\'s next step was to make your uncle\\r\\nacquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street\\r\\nthe evening before I came home.  But Mr. Gardiner could not be\\r\\nseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father\\r\\nwas still with him, but would quit town the next morning.  He\\r\\ndid not judge your father to be a person whom he could so\\r\\nproperly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\\r\\nseeing him till after the departure of the former.  He did not\\r\\nleave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a\\r\\ngentleman had called on business.  On Saturday he came again.\\r\\nYour father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said\\r\\nbefore, they had a great deal of talk together.  They met again\\r\\non Sunday, and then I saw him too.  It was not all settled\\r\\nbefore Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\\r\\nLongbourn.  But our visitor was very obstinate.  I fancy,\\r\\nLizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\r\\nafter all.  He has been accused of many faults at different\\r\\ntimes, but this is the true one.  Nothing was to be done that\\r\\nhe did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it\\r\\nto be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle\\r\\nwould most readily have settled the whole.  They battled it\\r\\ntogether for a long time, which was more than either the\\r\\ngentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.  But at last your\\r\\nuncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be\\r\\nof use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the\\r\\nprobable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and\\r\\nI really believe your letter this morning gave him great\\r\\npleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him\\r\\nof his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.\\r\\nBut, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at\\r\\nmost.  You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for\\r\\nthe young people.  His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\\r\\nbelieve, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\\r\\nthousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his\\r\\ncommission purchased.  The reason why all this was to be done\\r\\nby him alone, was such as I have given above.  It was owing to\\r\\nhim, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\\r\\nWickham\\'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently\\r\\nthat he had been received and noticed as he was.  Perhaps there\\r\\nwas some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve,\\r\\nor anybody\\'s reserve, can be answerable for the event.  But\\r\\nin spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest\\r\\nperfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if\\r\\nwe had not given him credit for another interest in the\\r\\naffair.  When all this was resolved on, he returned again to\\r\\nhis friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was\\r\\nagreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding\\r\\ntook place, and all money matters were then to receive the last\\r\\nfinish.  I believe I have now told you every thing.  It is a\\r\\nrelation which you tell me is to give you great surprise;\\r\\nI hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.\\r\\nLydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the\\r\\nhouse.  He was exactly what he had been when I knew him in\\r\\nHertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\\r\\nsatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I\\r\\nhad not perceived, by Jane\\'s letter last Wednesday, that her\\r\\nconduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and\\r\\ntherefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.\\r\\nI talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\\r\\nrepresenting to her all the wickedness of what she had done,\\r\\nand all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.  If she\\r\\nheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not\\r\\nlisten.  I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected\\r\\nmy dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience\\r\\nwith her.  Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia\\r\\ninformed you, attended the wedding.  He dined with us the next\\r\\nday, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.\\r\\nWill you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this\\r\\nopportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say\\r\\nbefore) how much I like him.  His behaviour to us has, in every\\r\\nrespect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\\r\\na little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently,\\r\\nhis wife may teach him.  I thought him very sly; -- he hardly\\r\\never mentioned your name.  But slyness seems the fashion.  Pray\\r\\nforgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\\r\\npunish me so far as to exclude me from P.  I shall never be\\r\\nquite happy till I have been all round the park.  A low\\r\\nphaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very\\r\\nthing.  But I must write no more.  The children have been\\r\\nwanting me this half hour.  Your\\'s, very sincerely,\\r\\n\\r\\nM. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter\\r\\nof spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether\\r\\npleasure or pain bore the greatest share.  The vague and\\r\\nunsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what\\r\\nMr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\\'s match,\\r\\nwhich she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness\\r\\ntoo great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\\r\\njust, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their\\r\\ngreatest extent to be true!  He had followed them purposely to\\r\\ntown, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification\\r\\nattendant on such a research; in which supplication had been\\r\\nnecessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and\\r\\nwhere he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,\\r\\npersuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished\\r\\nto avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\\r\\npronounce.  He had done all this for a girl whom he could\\r\\nneither regard nor esteem.  Her heart did whisper that he had\\r\\ndone it for her.  But it was a hope shortly checked by other\\r\\nconsiderations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was\\r\\ninsufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her\\r\\n-- for a woman who had already refused him -- as able to\\r\\novercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against\\r\\nrelationship with Wickham.  Brother-in-law of Wickham!  Every\\r\\nkind of pride must revolt from the connection.  He had, to be\\r\\nsure, done much.  She was ashamed to think how much.  But he\\r\\nhad given a reason for his interference, which asked no\\r\\nextraordinary stretch of belief.  It was reasonable that he\\r\\nshould feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had\\r\\nthe means of exercising it; and though she would not place\\r\\nherself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps,\\r\\nbelieve that remaining partiality for her might assist his\\r\\nendeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\\r\\nmaterially concerned.  It was painful, exceedingly painful, to\\r\\nknow that they were under obligations to a person who could\\r\\nnever receive a return.  They owed the restoration of Lydia,\\r\\nher character, every thing, to him.  Oh!  how heartily did she\\r\\ngrieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,\\r\\nevery saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.  For\\r\\nherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.  Proud that\\r\\nin a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get\\r\\nthe better of himself.  She read over her aunt\\'s commendation\\r\\nof him again and again.  It was hardly enough; but it pleased\\r\\nher.  She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with\\r\\nregret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had\\r\\nbeen persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between\\r\\nMr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some\\r\\none\\'s approach; and before she could strike into another path,\\r\\nshe was overtaken by Wickham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\"\\r\\nsaid he, as he joined her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does not\\r\\nfollow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.  We were always good\\r\\nfriends; and now we are better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  Are the others coming out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the\\r\\ncarriage to Meryton.  And so, my dear sister, I find, from\\r\\nour uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would\\r\\nbe too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to\\r\\nNewcastle.  And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?  Poor\\r\\nReynolds, she was always very fond of me.  But of course she\\r\\ndid not mention my name to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\\r\\n-- not turned out well.  At such a distance as that, you\\r\\nknow, things are strangely misrepresented.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips.  Elizabeth hoped she\\r\\nhad silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.  We passed\\r\\neach other several times.  I wonder what he can be doing\\r\\nthere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"It must be something particular, to take him there\\r\\nat this time of year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly.  Did you see him while you were at Lambton?\\r\\nI thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you like her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within\\r\\nthis year or two.  When I last saw her, she was not very\\r\\npromising.  I am very glad you liked her.  I hope she will turn\\r\\nout well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\\r\\nhad.  A most delightful place! -- Excellent Parsonage House!\\r\\nIt would have suited me in every respect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceedingly well.  I should have considered it as part of my\\r\\nduty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.  One ought\\r\\nnot to repine; -- but, to be sure, it would have been such a\\r\\nthing for me!  The quiet, the retirement of such a life would\\r\\nhave answered all my ideas of happiness!  But it was not to be.\\r\\nDid you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were\\r\\nin Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good,\\r\\nthat it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\\r\\npresent patron.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have.  Yes, there was something in that; I told you so\\r\\nfrom the first, you may remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making\\r\\nwas not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that\\r\\nyou actually declared your resolution of never taking orders,\\r\\nand that the business had been compromised accordingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did!  and it was not wholly without foundation.  You may\\r\\nremember what I told you on that point, when first we talked\\r\\nof it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she\\r\\nhad walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her\\r\\nsister\\'s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with\\r\\na good-humoured smile,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.\\r\\nDo not let us quarrel about the past.  In future, I hope we\\r\\nshall be always of one mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate\\r\\ngallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they\\r\\nentered the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 53\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation\\r\\nthat he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear\\r\\nsister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was\\r\\npleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day of his and Lydia\\'s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwas forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by\\r\\nno means entered into her scheme of their all going to\\r\\nNewcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  I don\\'t know.  Not these two or three years,\\r\\nperhaps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As often as I can.  But you know married women have never much\\r\\ntime for writing.  My sisters may write to me.  They will\\r\\nhave nothing else to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s adieus were much more affectionate than his\\r\\nwife\\'s.  He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were\\r\\nout of the house, \"as ever I saw.  He simpers, and smirks, and\\r\\nmakes love to us all.  I am prodigiously proud of him.  I defy\\r\\neven Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable\\r\\nson-in-law.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for\\r\\nseveral days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as\\r\\nparting with one\\'s friends.  One seems so forlorn without\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying\\r\\na daughter,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It must make you better\\r\\nsatisfied that your other four are single.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no such thing.  Lydia does not leave me because she is\\r\\nmarried, but only because her husband\\'s regiment happens to be\\r\\nso far off.  If that had been nearer, she would not have gone\\r\\nso soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into\\r\\nwas shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the\\r\\nagitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be\\r\\nin circulation.  The housekeeper at Netherfield had received\\r\\norders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming\\r\\ndown in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.  She looked at Jane, and\\r\\nsmiled and shook her head by turns.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\"\\r\\n(for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news).  \"Well, so\\r\\nmuch the better.  Not that I care about it, though.  He is\\r\\nnothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to\\r\\nsee him again.  But, however, he is very welcome to come to\\r\\nNetherfield, if he likes it.  And who knows what may\\r\\nhappen?  But that is nothing to us.  You know, sister, we\\r\\nagreed long ago never to mention a word about it.  And so,\\r\\nis it quite certain he is coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls\\r\\nwas in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out\\r\\nmyself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that\\r\\nit was certain true.  He comes down on Thursday at the latest,\\r\\nvery likely on Wednesday.  She was going to the butcher\\'s, she\\r\\ntold me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she\\r\\nhas got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without\\r\\nchanging colour.  It was many months since she had mentioned\\r\\nhis name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone\\r\\ntogether, she said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of\\r\\nthe present report; and I know I appeared distressed.  But\\r\\ndon\\'t imagine it was from any silly cause.  I was only confused\\r\\nfor the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at.\\r\\nI do assure you that the news does not affect me either with\\r\\npleasure or pain.  I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone;\\r\\nbecause we shall see the less of him.  Not that I am afraid of\\r\\nmyself, but I dread other people\\'s remarks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it.  Had she not seen\\r\\nhim in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of\\r\\ncoming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but\\r\\nshe still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to\\r\\nthe greater probability of his coming there with his friend\\'s\\r\\npermission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man\\r\\ncannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without\\r\\nraising all this speculation!  I will leave him to himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be\\r\\nher feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could\\r\\neasily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.  They\\r\\nwere more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their\\r\\nparents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"you will wait on him of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no.  You forced me into visiting him last year, and\\r\\npromised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my\\r\\ndaughters.  But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on\\r\\na fool\\'s errand again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an\\r\\nattention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he.  \"If he wants our\\r\\nsociety, let him seek it.  He knows where we live.  I will not\\r\\nspend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they\\r\\ngo away and come back again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do\\r\\nnot wait on him.  But, however, that shan\\'t prevent my asking\\r\\nhim to dine here, I am determined.  We must have Mrs. Long and\\r\\nthe Gouldings soon.  That will make thirteen with ourselves, so\\r\\nthere will be just room at table for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear\\r\\nher husband\\'s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know\\r\\nthat her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence\\r\\nof it, before they did.  As the day of his arrival drew near,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her\\r\\nsister.  \"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect\\r\\nindifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually\\r\\ntalked of.  My mother means well; but she does not know, no one\\r\\ncan know, how much I suffer from what she says.  Happy shall I\\r\\nbe, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth; \"but it is wholly out of my power.  You must feel\\r\\nit; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a\\r\\nsufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley arrived.  Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of\\r\\nservants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that\\r\\nthe period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as\\r\\nlong as it could.  She counted the days that must intervene\\r\\nbefore their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him\\r\\nbefore.  But on the third morning after his arrival in\\r\\nHertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\\r\\nenter the paddock and ride towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.  Jane\\r\\nresolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to\\r\\nsatisfy her mother, went to the window -- she looked, -- she\\r\\nsaw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it\\r\\nbe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I\\r\\ndo not know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to\\r\\nbe with him before.  Mr. what\\'s-his-name.  That tall, proud\\r\\nman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Mr. Darcy! -- and so it does, I vow.  Well,\\r\\nany friend of Mr. Bingley\\'s will always be welcome here, to be\\r\\nsure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.  She knew\\r\\nbut little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt\\r\\nfor the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him\\r\\nalmost for the first time after receiving his explanatory\\r\\nletter.  Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.  Each felt for\\r\\nthe other, and of course for themselves; and their mother\\r\\ntalked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to\\r\\nbe civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\\'s friend, without being\\r\\nheard by either of them.  But Elizabeth had sources of\\r\\nuneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she\\r\\nhad never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\\'s letter, or to\\r\\nrelate her own change of sentiment towards him.  To Jane, he\\r\\ncould be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose\\r\\nmerit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\\r\\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were\\r\\nindebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded\\r\\nherself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as\\r\\nreasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley.  Her\\r\\nastonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield, to\\r\\nLongbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal\\r\\nto what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour\\r\\nin Derbyshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for\\r\\nhalf a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight\\r\\nadded lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time\\r\\nthat his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.  But she\\r\\nwould not be secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be\\r\\nearly enough for expectation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without\\r\\ndaring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them\\r\\nto the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the\\r\\ndoor.  Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate\\r\\nthan Elizabeth had expected.  On the gentlemen\\'s appearing, her\\r\\ncolour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease,\\r\\nand with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom\\r\\nof resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and\\r\\nsat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not\\r\\noften command.  She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.  He\\r\\nlooked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been\\r\\nused to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at\\r\\nPemberley.  But, perhaps he could not in her mother\\'s presence\\r\\nbe what he was before her uncle and aunt.  It was a painful,\\r\\nbut not an improbable, conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that\\r\\nshort period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.  He\\r\\nwas received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which\\r\\nmade her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with\\r\\nthe cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address\\r\\nto his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the\\r\\nlatter the preservation of her favourite daughter from\\r\\nirremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful\\r\\ndegree by a distinction so ill applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a\\r\\nquestion which she could not answer without confusion, said\\r\\nscarcely any thing.  He was not seated by her; perhaps that was\\r\\nthe reason of his silence; but it had not been so in\\r\\nDerbyshire.  There he had talked to her friends, when he could\\r\\nnot to herself.  But now several minutes elapsed without\\r\\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable\\r\\nto resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his\\r\\nface, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and\\r\\nfrequently on no object but the ground.  More thoughtfulness\\r\\nand less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were\\r\\nplainly expressed.  She was disappointed, and angry with\\r\\nherself for being so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she.  \"Yet why did\\r\\nhe come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself;\\r\\nand to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.  \"I began to be afraid you would never come back\\r\\nagain.  People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;\\r\\nbut, however, I hope it is not true.  A great many changes have\\r\\nhappened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.  Miss Lucas\\r\\nis married and settled.  And one of my own daughters.\\r\\nI suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen\\r\\nit in the papers.  It was in The Times and The Courier, I\\r\\nknow; though it was not put in as it ought to be.  It was only\\r\\nsaid, ``Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\\'\\'\\r\\nwithout there being a syllable said of her father, or the place\\r\\nwhere she lived, or any thing.  It was my brother Gardiner\\'s\\r\\ndrawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an\\r\\nawkward business of it.  Did you see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\\r\\nElizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.  How Mr. Darcy looked,\\r\\ntherefore, she could not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter\\r\\nwell married,\" continued her mother, \"but at the same time,\\r\\nMr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from\\r\\nme.  They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward,\\r\\nit seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long.\\r\\nHis regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his\\r\\nleaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.\\r\\nThank Heaven!  he has some friends, though perhaps not so\\r\\nmany as he deserves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was\\r\\nin such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.\\r\\nIt drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which\\r\\nnothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked\\r\\nBingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at\\r\\npresent.  A few weeks, he believed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\"\\r\\nsaid her mother, \"I beg you will come here, and shoot as\\r\\nmany as you please on Mr. Bennet\\'s manor.  I am sure he\\r\\nwill be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the\\r\\nbest of the covies for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such\\r\\nofficious attention!  Were the same fair prospect to arise at\\r\\npresent as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was\\r\\npersuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.\\r\\nAt that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not\\r\\nmake Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful\\r\\nconfusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never\\r\\nmore to be in company with either of them.  Their society can\\r\\nafford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as\\r\\nthis!  Let me never see either one or the other again!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\r\\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from\\r\\nobserving how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the\\r\\nadmiration of her former lover.  When first he came in, he had\\r\\nspoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be\\r\\ngiving her more of his attention.  He found her as handsome as\\r\\nshe had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected,\\r\\nthough not quite so chatty.  Jane was anxious that no\\r\\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really\\r\\npersuaded that she talked as much as ever.  But her mind was\\r\\nso busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of\\r\\nher intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to\\r\\ndine at Longbourn in a few days time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added,\\r\\n\"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take\\r\\na family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.  I have not\\r\\nforgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed\\r\\nthat you did not come back and keep your engagement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said\\r\\nsomething of his concern at having been prevented by business.\\r\\nThey then went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and\\r\\ndine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good\\r\\ntable, she did not think any thing less than two courses could\\r\\nbe good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs,\\r\\nor satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 54\\r\\n\\r\\nAS soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover\\r\\nher spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption\\r\\non those subjects that must deaden them more.  Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nbehaviour astonished and vexed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\"\\r\\nsaid she, \"did he come at all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and\\r\\naunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?  If he fears me,\\r\\nwhy come hither?  If he no longer cares for me, why silent?\\r\\nTeazing, teazing, man!  I will think no more about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by\\r\\nthe approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful\\r\\nlook, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors,\\r\\nthan Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel\\r\\nperfectly easy.  I know my own strength, and I shall never be\\r\\nembarrassed again by his coming.  I am glad he dines here on\\r\\nTuesday.  It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides,\\r\\nwe meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly.\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, take care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger\\r\\nnow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much\\r\\nin love with you as ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the\\r\\nhappy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness\\r\\nof Bingley, in half an hour\\'s visit, had revived.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn;\\r\\nand the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of\\r\\ntheir punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.  When\\r\\nthey repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to\\r\\nsee whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their\\r\\nformer parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.  Her\\r\\nprudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite\\r\\nhim to sit by herself.  On entering the room, he seemed to\\r\\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to\\r\\nsmile: it was decided.  He placed himself by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\\r\\nfriend.  He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\\r\\nimagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy,\\r\\nhad she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nwith an expression of half-laughing alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\\r\\nshewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than\\r\\nformerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,\\r\\nJane\\'s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.\\r\\nThough she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet\\r\\nreceived pleasure from observing his behaviour.  It gave her\\r\\nall the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\\r\\nno cheerful humour.  Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as\\r\\nthe table could divide them.  He was on one side of her mother.\\r\\nShe knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to\\r\\neither, or make either appear to advantage.  She was not near\\r\\nenough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how\\r\\nseldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was\\r\\ntheir manner whenever they did.  Her mother\\'s ungraciousness,\\r\\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind; and she would, at times, have given any\\r\\nthing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was\\r\\nneither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity\\r\\nof bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would\\r\\nnot pass away without enabling them to enter into something\\r\\nmore of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation\\r\\nattending his entrance.  Anxious and uneasy, the period which\\r\\npassed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was\\r\\nwearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\\r\\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\\r\\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he does not come to me, then,\" said she, \"I shall give\\r\\nhim up for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would\\r\\nhave answered her hopes; but, alas!  the ladies had crowded\\r\\nround the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and\\r\\nElizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy\\r\\nthat there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit\\r\\nof a chair.  And on the gentlemen\\'s approaching, one of the\\r\\ngirls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The men shan\\'t come and part us, I am determined.  We want\\r\\nnone of them; do we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room.  She\\r\\nfollowed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke,\\r\\nhad scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and\\r\\nthen was enraged against herself for being so silly!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who has once been refused!  How could I ever be foolish\\r\\nenough to expect a renewal of his love?  Is there one among the\\r\\nsex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second\\r\\nproposal to the same woman?  There is no indignity so abhorrent\\r\\nto their feelings!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\\r\\ncoffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And quite alone?  Have all her friends left her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her.  The others have been gone on to\\r\\nScarborough, these three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to\\r\\nconverse with her, he might have better success.  He stood by\\r\\nher, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on\\r\\nthe young lady\\'s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed,\\r\\nthe ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon\\r\\njoined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him\\r\\nfall a victim to her mother\\'s rapacity for whist players, and\\r\\nin a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.  She\\r\\nnow lost every expectation of pleasure.  They were confined for\\r\\nthe evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope,\\r\\nbut that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the\\r\\nroom, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen\\r\\nto supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any\\r\\nof the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to\\r\\nthemselves, \"What say you to the day?  I think every thing has\\r\\npassed off uncommonly well, I assure you.  The dinner was as\\r\\nwell dressed as any I ever saw.  The venison was roasted to a\\r\\nturn -- and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch.  The\\r\\nsoup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases\\'\\r\\nlast week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\\r\\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three\\r\\nFrench cooks at least.  And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look\\r\\nin greater beauty.  Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her\\r\\nwhether you did not.  And what do you think she said besides?\\r\\n``Ah!  Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\\'\\'\\r\\nShe did indeed.  I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as\\r\\never lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and\\r\\nnot at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen\\r\\nenough of Bingley\\'s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she\\r\\nwould get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her\\r\\nfamily, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that\\r\\nshe was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the\\r\\nnext day, to make his proposals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable\\r\\none with the other.  I hope we may often meet again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so.  You must not suspect me.  It\\r\\nmortifies me.  I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy\\r\\nhis conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man,\\r\\nwithout having a wish beyond it.  I am perfectly satisfied,\\r\\nfrom what his manners now are, that he never had any design\\r\\nof engaging my affection.  It is only that he is blessed\\r\\nwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of\\r\\ngenerally pleasing, than any other man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me\\r\\nsmile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how impossible in others!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\r\\nacknowledge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.  We all\\r\\nlove to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth\\r\\nknowing.  Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do\\r\\nnot make me your confidante.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 55\\r\\n\\r\\nA FEW days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and\\r\\nalone.  His friend had left him that morning for London, but\\r\\nwas to return home in ten days time.  He sat with them above an\\r\\nhour, and was in remarkably good spirits.  Mrs. Bennet invited\\r\\nhim to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern,\\r\\nhe confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more\\r\\nlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if\\r\\nshe would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of\\r\\nwaiting on them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her\\r\\ninvitation was accepted with alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none\\r\\nof them dressed.  In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\\'s room, in\\r\\nher dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.  He is come --\\r\\nMr. Bingley is come. -- He is, indeed.  Make haste, make haste.\\r\\nHere, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on\\r\\nwith her gown.  Never mind Miss Lizzy\\'s hair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say\\r\\nKitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs\\r\\nhalf an hour ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  hang Kitty!  what has she to do with it?  Come be quick,\\r\\nbe quick!  Where is your sash, my dear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to\\r\\ngo down without one of her sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again\\r\\nin the evening.  After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library,\\r\\nas was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.\\r\\nTwo obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a\\r\\nconsiderable time, without making any impression on them.\\r\\nElizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did,\\r\\nshe very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma?  What do\\r\\nyou keep winking at me for?  What am I to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing child, nothing.  I did not wink at you.\"  She then sat\\r\\nstill five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious\\r\\noccasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \"Come here,\\r\\nmy love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room.\\r\\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her\\r\\ndistress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she\\r\\nwould not give in to it.  In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nhalf-opened the door and called out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her\\r\\nmother, as soon as she was in the hall.  \"Kitty and I are going\\r\\nup stairs to sit in my dressing room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but\\r\\nremained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of\\r\\nsight, then returned into the drawing room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s schemes for this day were ineffectual.  Bingley\\r\\nwas every thing that was charming, except the professed lover\\r\\nof her daughter.  His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a\\r\\nmost agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore\\r\\nwith the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all\\r\\nher silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance\\r\\nparticularly grateful to the daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he\\r\\nwent away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own\\r\\nand Mrs. Bennet\\'s means, for his coming next morning to shoot\\r\\nwith her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.\\r\\nNot a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but\\r\\nElizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must\\r\\nspeedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the\\r\\nstated time.  Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded\\r\\nthat all this must have taken place with that gentleman\\'s\\r\\nconcurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet\\r\\nspent the morning together, as had been agreed on.  The latter\\r\\nwas much more agreeable than his companion expected.  There was\\r\\nnothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke\\r\\nhis ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more\\r\\ncommunicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen\\r\\nhim.  Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the\\r\\nevening Mrs. Bennet\\'s invention was again at work to get every\\r\\nbody away from him and her daughter.  Elizabeth, who had a\\r\\nletter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose\\r\\nsoon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to\\r\\ncards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother\\'s\\r\\nschemes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was\\r\\nfinished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was\\r\\nreason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for\\r\\nher.  On opening the door, she perceived her sister and\\r\\nBingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\\r\\nearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the\\r\\nfaces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away\\r\\nfrom each other, would have told it all.  Their situation\\r\\nwas awkward enough; but her\\'s she thought was still worse.\\r\\nNot a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on\\r\\nthe point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as\\r\\nthe other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\\r\\nwords to her sister, ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence\\r\\nwould give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,\\r\\nwith the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature\\r\\nin the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much.  I do not\\r\\ndeserve it.  Oh!  why is not every body as happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a\\r\\nwarmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.  Every\\r\\nsentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.\\r\\nBut she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say\\r\\nhalf that remained to be said for the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried.  \"I would not on\\r\\nany account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow\\r\\nher to hear it from any one but myself.  He is gone to my\\r\\nfather already.  Oh!  Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate\\r\\nwill give such pleasure to all my dear family!  how shall I\\r\\nbear so much happiness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken\\r\\nup the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity\\r\\nand ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had\\r\\ngiven them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend\\'s anxious\\r\\ncircumspection!  of all his sister\\'s falsehood and contrivance!\\r\\nthe happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference\\r\\nwith her father had been short and to the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With my mother up stairs.  She will be down in a moment,\\r\\nI dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good\\r\\nwishes and affection of a sister.  Elizabeth honestly and\\r\\nheartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their\\r\\nrelationship.  They shook hands with great cordiality; and\\r\\nthen, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he\\r\\nhad to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\\'s perfections;\\r\\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed\\r\\nall his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded,\\r\\nbecause they had for basis the excellent understanding, and\\r\\nsuper-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity\\r\\nof feeling and taste between her and himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the\\r\\nsatisfaction of Miss Bennet\\'s mind gave a glow of such sweet\\r\\nanimation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\\r\\nKitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation\\r\\nin terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked\\r\\nto Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr.\\r\\nBennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly\\r\\nshewed how really happy he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till\\r\\ntheir visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone, he turned to his daughter, and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jane, I congratulate you.  You will be a very happy woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\r\\ngoodness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure\\r\\nin thinking you will be so happily settled.  I have not a doubt\\r\\nof your doing very well together.  Your tempers are by no means\\r\\nunlike.  You are each of you so complying, that nothing will\\r\\never be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat\\r\\nyou; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not so.  Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters\\r\\nwould be unpardonable in me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceed their income!  My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife,\\r\\n\"what are you talking of?  Why, he has four or five thousand a\\r\\nyear, and very likely more.\"  Then addressing her daughter,\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!  I am sure I shan\\'t\\r\\nget a wink of sleep all night.  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nalways said it must be so, at last.  I was sure you could not\\r\\nbe so beautiful for nothing!  I remember, as soon as ever I saw\\r\\nhim, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought\\r\\nhow likely it was that you should come together.  Oh!  he is\\r\\nthe handsomest young man that ever was seen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.  Jane was beyond\\r\\ncompetition her favourite child.  At that moment, she cared\\r\\nfor no other.  Her younger sisters soon began to make interest\\r\\nwith her for objects of happiness which she might in future be\\r\\nable to dispense.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and\\r\\nKitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at\\r\\nLongbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always\\r\\nremaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous\\r\\nneighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him\\r\\nan invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to\\r\\naccept.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her\\r\\nsister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to\\r\\nbestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably\\r\\nuseful to both of them in those hours of separation that must\\r\\nsometimes occur.  In the absence of Jane, he always attached\\r\\nhimself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and\\r\\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means\\r\\nof relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling\\r\\nme that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last\\r\\nspring!  I had not believed it possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But how did he\\r\\naccount for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must have been his sister\\'s doing.  They were certainly no\\r\\nfriends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,\\r\\nsince he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many\\r\\nrespects.  But when they see, as I trust they will, that their\\r\\nbrother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and\\r\\nwe shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we\\r\\nonce were to each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that\\r\\nI ever heard you utter.  Good girl!  It would vex me, indeed,\\r\\nto see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley\\'s pretended regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last\\r\\nNovember, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of\\r\\nmy being indifferent would have prevented his coming down\\r\\nagain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit\\r\\nof his modesty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his\\r\\ndiffidence, and the little value he put on his own good\\r\\nqualities.  Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not\\r\\nbetrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had\\r\\nthe most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew\\r\\nit was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\"\\r\\ncried Jane.  \"Oh!  Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family,\\r\\nand blessed above them all!  If I could but see you as happy!\\r\\nIf there were but such another man for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so\\r\\nhappy as you.  Till I have your disposition, your goodness,\\r\\nI never can have your happiness.  No, no, let me shift for\\r\\nmyself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet\\r\\nwith another Mr. Collins in time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be\\r\\nlong a secret.  Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to\\r\\nMrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do\\r\\nthe same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family\\r\\nin the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had\\r\\nfirst run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out\\r\\nfor misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 56\\r\\n\\r\\nONE morning, about a week after Bingley\\'s engagement with\\r\\nJane had been formed, as he and the females of the family\\r\\nwere sitting together in the dining room, their attention\\r\\nwas suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage;\\r\\nand they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.\\r\\nIt was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\\r\\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.\\r\\nThe horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery\\r\\nof the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.  As it\\r\\nwas certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley\\r\\ninstantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of\\r\\nsuch an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.\\r\\nThey both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\\r\\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was\\r\\nthrown open and their visitor entered.  It was Lady Catherine\\r\\nde Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\r\\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to\\r\\nthem, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,\\r\\nmade no other reply to Elizabeth\\'s salutation than a slight\\r\\ninclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\\r\\nElizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her\\r\\nladyship\\'s entrance, though no request of introduction had been\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a\\r\\nguest of such high importance, received her with the utmost\\r\\npoliteness.  After sitting for a moment in silence, she said\\r\\nvery stiffly to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.  That lady, I suppose,\\r\\nis your mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  \"She is my youngest girl but one.  My youngest of\\r\\nall is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the\\r\\ngrounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon\\r\\nbecome a part of the family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine\\r\\nafter a short silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say;\\r\\nbut I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,\\r\\nin summer; the windows are full west.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,\\r\\nand then added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you\\r\\nleft Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very well.  I saw them the night before last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for\\r\\nher from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for\\r\\nher calling.  But no letter appeared, and she was completely\\r\\npuzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take\\r\\nsome refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not\\r\\nvery politely, declined eating any thing; and then, rising up,\\r\\nsaid to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\\r\\nwilderness on one side of your lawn.  I should be glad to take\\r\\na turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and shew her ladyship about\\r\\nthe different walks.  I think she will be pleased with the\\r\\nhermitage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her\\r\\nparasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.  As they passed\\r\\nthrough the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the\\r\\ndining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a\\r\\nshort survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\r\\nwaiting-woman was in it.  They proceeded in silence along the\\r\\ngravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to\\r\\nmake no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more\\r\\nthan usually insolent and disagreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she\\r\\nlooked in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the\\r\\nfollowing manner: --\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason\\r\\nof my journey hither.  Your own heart, your own conscience,\\r\\nmust tell you why I come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.  I have not been at all able\\r\\nto account for the honour of seeing you here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you\\r\\nought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.  But however\\r\\ninsincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.\\r\\nMy character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and\\r\\nfrankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not depart from it.  A report of a most alarming\\r\\nnature reached me two days ago.  I was told that not only your\\r\\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married,\\r\\nbut that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all\\r\\nlikelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own\\r\\nnephew, Mr. Darcy.  Though I know it must be a scandalous\\r\\nfalsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose\\r\\nthe truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off\\r\\nfor this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\ncolouring with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the\\r\\ntrouble of coming so far.  What could your ladyship propose by\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally\\r\\ncontradicted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if,\\r\\nindeed, such a report is in existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If!  Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?  Has it not\\r\\nbeen industriously circulated by yourselves?  Do you not know\\r\\nthat such a report is spread abroad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation\\r\\nfor it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your\\r\\nladyship.  You may ask questions which I shall not\\r\\nchoose to answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is not to be borne.  Miss Bennet, I insist on being\\r\\nsatisfied.  Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\\r\\nhis reason.  But your arts and allurements may, in a moment\\r\\nof infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself\\r\\nand to all his family.  You may have drawn him in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?  I have not been accustomed\\r\\nto such language as this.  I am almost the nearest relation he\\r\\nhas in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest\\r\\nconcerns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such\\r\\nbehaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me be rightly understood.  This match, to which you have\\r\\nthe presumption to aspire, can never take place.  No, never.\\r\\nMr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.  Now what have you to\\r\\nsay?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose\\r\\nhe will make an offer to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.  From their\\r\\ninfancy, they have been intended for each other.  It was the\\r\\nfavourite wish of his mother, as well as of her\\'s.  While in\\r\\ntheir cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment\\r\\nwhen the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their\\r\\nmarriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth,\\r\\nof no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the\\r\\nfamily!  Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?\\r\\nTo his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?  Are you lost to\\r\\nevery feeling of propriety and delicacy?  Have you not heard\\r\\nme say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his\\r\\ncousin?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before.  But what is that to me?  If\\r\\nthere is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and\\r\\naunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.  You both did as much\\r\\nas you could in planning the marriage.  Its completion depended\\r\\non others.  If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination\\r\\nconfined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?\\r\\nAnd if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\\r\\nYes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed\\r\\nby his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\\r\\ninclinations of all.  You will be censured, slighted, and\\r\\ndespised, by every one connected with him.  Your alliance will\\r\\nbe a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any\\r\\nof us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But the\\r\\nwife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of\\r\\nhappiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she\\r\\ncould, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl!  I am ashamed of you!  Is this\\r\\nyour gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?  Is\\r\\nnothing due to me on that score?  Let us sit down.  You are to\\r\\nunderstand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined\\r\\nresolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded\\r\\nfrom it.  I have not been used to submit to any person\\'s whims.\\r\\nI have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will make your ladyship\\'s situation at present more\\r\\npitiable; but it will have no effect on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not be interrupted.  Hear me in silence.  My daughter\\r\\nand my nephew are formed for each other.  They are descended,\\r\\non the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the\\r\\nfather\\'s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient -- though\\r\\nuntitled -- families.  Their fortune on both sides is splendid.\\r\\nThey are destined for each other by the voice of every member\\r\\nof their respective houses; and what is to divide them?  The\\r\\nupstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\\r\\nconnections, or fortune.  Is this to be endured!  But it\\r\\nmust not, shall not be.  If you were sensible of your own\\r\\ngood, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you\\r\\nhave been brought up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\\r\\nquitting that sphere.  He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\\'s\\r\\ndaughter; so far we are equal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  You are a gentleman\\'s daughter.  But who was your\\r\\nmother?  Who are your uncles and aunts?  Do not imagine me\\r\\nignorant of their condition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your\\r\\nnephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging\\r\\nLady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but\\r\\nsay, after a moment\\'s deliberation,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an\\r\\nengagement?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.  I expected to find a\\r\\nmore reasonable young woman.  But do not deceive yourself into\\r\\na belief that I will ever recede.  I shall not go away till you\\r\\nhave given me the assurance I require.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I certainly never shall give it.  I am not to be\\r\\nintimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.  Your\\r\\nladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would\\r\\nmy giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at\\r\\nall more probable?  Supposing him to be attached to me,\\r\\nwould my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow\\r\\nit on his cousin?  Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the\\r\\narguments with which you have supported this extraordinary\\r\\napplication have been as frivolous as the application was\\r\\nill-judged.  You have widely mistaken my character, if you\\r\\nthink I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\\r\\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in\\r\\nhis affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no\\r\\nright to concern yourself in mine.  I must beg, therefore,\\r\\nto be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so hasty, if you please.  I have by no means done.\\r\\nTo all the objections I have already urged, I have still\\r\\nanother to add.  I am no stranger to the particulars of your\\r\\nyoungest sister\\'s infamous elopement.  I know it all; that\\r\\nthe young man\\'s marrying her was a patched-up business, at\\r\\nthe expence of your father and uncles.  And is such a girl\\r\\nto be my nephew\\'s sister?  Is her husband, is the son of\\r\\nhis late father\\'s steward, to be his brother?  Heaven and\\r\\nearth! -- of what are you thinking?  Are the shades of\\r\\nPemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can now have nothing farther to say,\" she resentfully\\r\\nanswered.  \"You have insulted me in every possible method.\\r\\nI must beg to return to the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she rose as she spoke.  Lady Catherine rose also, and they\\r\\nturned back.  Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my\\r\\nnephew!  Unfeeling, selfish girl!  Do you not consider that\\r\\na connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of\\r\\neverybody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.  You know my\\r\\nsentiments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have said no such thing.  I am only resolved to act in that\\r\\nmanner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,\\r\\nwithout reference to you, or to any person so wholly\\r\\nunconnected with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is well.  You refuse, then, to oblige me.  You refuse to\\r\\nobey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.  You are\\r\\ndetermined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and\\r\\nmake him the contempt of the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\n\"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.  No\\r\\nprinciple of either would be violated by my marriage with\\r\\nMr. Darcy.  And with regard to the resentment of his family, or\\r\\nthe indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his\\r\\nmarrying me, it would not give me one moment\\'s concern -- and\\r\\nthe world in general would have too much sense to join in the\\r\\nscorn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is your real opinion!  This is your final resolve!\\r\\nVery well.  I shall now know how to act.  Do not imagine, Miss\\r\\nBennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.  I came to\\r\\ntry you.  I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it,\\r\\nI will carry my point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the\\r\\ndoor of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,\\r\\n\"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.  I send no compliments to\\r\\nyour mother.  You deserve no such attention.  I am most\\r\\nseriously displeased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade\\r\\nher ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it\\r\\nherself.  She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up\\r\\nstairs.  Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the\\r\\ndressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in\\r\\nagain and rest herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman!  and her calling here was\\r\\nprodigiously civil!  for she only came, I suppose, to tell us\\r\\nthe Collinses were well.  She is on her road somewhere, I dare\\r\\nsay, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well\\r\\ncall on you.  I suppose she had nothing particular to say to\\r\\nyou, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here;\\r\\nfor to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was\\r\\nimpossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 57\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit\\r\\nthrew Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could\\r\\nshe, for many hours, learn to think of it less than\\r\\nincessantly.  Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken\\r\\nthe trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose\\r\\nof breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.  It was\\r\\na rational scheme, to be sure!  but from what the report of\\r\\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to\\r\\nimagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate\\r\\nfriend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was\\r\\nenough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made\\r\\nevery body eager for another, to supply the idea.  She had not\\r\\nherself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must\\r\\nbring them more frequently together.  And her neighbours at\\r\\nLucas lodge, therefore (for through their communication with\\r\\nthe Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady\\r\\nCatherine), had only set that down as almost certain and\\r\\nimmediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at\\r\\nsome future time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn revolving Lady Catherine\\'s expressions, however, she could\\r\\nnot help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence\\r\\nof her persisting in this interference.  From what she had said\\r\\nof her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to\\r\\nElizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;\\r\\nand how he might take a similar representation of the evils\\r\\nattached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.\\r\\nShe knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or\\r\\nhis dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\\r\\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could\\r\\ndo; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a\\r\\nmarriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal\\r\\nto his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.\\r\\nWith his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the\\r\\narguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous,\\r\\ncontained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which\\r\\nhad often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a\\r\\nrelation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to\\r\\nbe as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.  In that\\r\\ncase he would return no more.  Lady Catherine might see him in\\r\\nher way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming\\r\\nagain to Netherfield must give way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should\\r\\ncome to his friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall\\r\\nknow how to understand it.  I shall then give over every\\r\\nexpectation, every wish of his constancy.  If he is satisfied\\r\\nwith only regretting me, when he might have obtained my\\r\\naffections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their\\r\\nvisitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\\r\\nit, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much\\r\\nteazing on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by\\r\\nher father, who came out of his library with a letter in his\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my\\r\\nroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he\\r\\nhad to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being\\r\\nin some manner connected with the letter he held.  It suddenly\\r\\nstruck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she\\r\\nanticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\\r\\ndown.  He then said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\r\\nexceedingly.  As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to\\r\\nknow its contents.  I did not know before, that I had two\\r\\ndaughters on the brink of matrimony.  Let me congratulate you\\r\\non a very important conquest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth\\'s cheeks in the\\r\\ninstantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,\\r\\ninstead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to\\r\\nbe pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that\\r\\nhis letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father\\r\\ncontinued,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You look conscious.  Young ladies have great penetration in\\r\\nsuch matters as these; but I think I may defy even your\\r\\nsagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.  This letter\\r\\nis from Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From Mr. Collins!  and what can he have to say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course.  He begins\\r\\nwith congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest\\r\\ndaughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the\\r\\ngood-natured, gossiping Lucases.  I shall not sport with your\\r\\nimpatience, by reading what he says on that point.  What\\r\\nrelates to yourself, is as follows.\"  \"Having thus offered\\r\\nyou the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\\r\\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject\\r\\nof another; of which we have been advertised by the same\\r\\nauthority.  Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not\\r\\nlong bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has\\r\\nresigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be\\r\\nreasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious\\r\\npersonages in this land.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\"  \"This\\r\\nyoung gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing\\r\\nthe heart of mortal can most desire, -- splendid property,\\r\\nnoble kindred, and extensive patronage.  Yet in spite of all\\r\\nthese temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and\\r\\nyourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure\\r\\nwith this gentleman\\'s proposals, which, of course, you will be\\r\\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?  But now it\\r\\ncomes out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My motive for cautioning you is as follows.  We have reason to\\r\\nimagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look\\r\\non the match with a friendly eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man!  Now, Lizzy, I think I\\r\\nhave surprised you.  Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched\\r\\non any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name\\r\\nwould have given the lie more effectually to what they related?\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish,\\r\\nand who probably never looked at you in his life!  It is\\r\\nadmirable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father\\'s pleasantry, but could\\r\\nonly force one most reluctant smile.  Never had his wit been\\r\\ndirected in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  yes.  Pray read on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her\\r\\nladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual\\r\\ncondescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it\\r\\nbecome apparent, that on the score of some family objections on\\r\\nthe part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what\\r\\nshe termed so disgraceful a match.  I thought it my duty to\\r\\ngive the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\\r\\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and\\r\\nnot run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly\\r\\nsanctioned.\"  \"Mr. Collins moreover adds,\" \"I am truly rejoiced\\r\\nthat my cousin Lydia\\'s sad business has been so well hushed up,\\r\\nand am only concerned that their living together before the\\r\\nmarriage took place should be so generally known.  I must not,\\r\\nhowever, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from\\r\\ndeclaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young\\r\\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married.  It was an\\r\\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn,\\r\\nI should very strenuously have opposed it.  You ought certainly\\r\\nto forgive them as a Christian, but never to admit them in your\\r\\nsight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.\"\\r\\n\"That is his notion of Christian forgiveness!  The rest of\\r\\nhis letter is only about his dear Charlotte\\'s situation, and\\r\\nhis expectation of a young olive-branch.  But, Lizzy, you look\\r\\nas if you did not enjoy it.  You are not going to be Missish,\\r\\nI hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.  For\\r\\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and\\r\\nlaugh at them in our turn?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted.  But it is\\r\\nso strange!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes -- that is what makes it amusing.  Had they fixed on\\r\\nany other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect\\r\\nindifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so\\r\\ndelightfully absurd!  Much as I abominate writing, I would not\\r\\ngive up Mr. Collins\\'s correspondence for any consideration.\\r\\nNay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the\\r\\npreference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\\r\\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law.  And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady\\r\\nCatherine about this report?  Did she call to refuse her\\r\\nconsent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and\\r\\nas it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not\\r\\ndistressed by his repeating it.  Elizabeth had never been\\r\\nmore at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.\\r\\nIt was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.\\r\\nHer father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder\\r\\nat such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\\r\\nhis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 58\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTEAD of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,\\r\\nas Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to\\r\\nbring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed\\r\\nafter Lady Catherine\\'s visit.  The gentlemen arrived early;\\r\\nand, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having\\r\\nseen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread,\\r\\nBingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all\\r\\nwalking out.  It was agreed to.  Mrs. Bennet was not in the\\r\\nhabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the\\r\\nremaining five set off together.  Bingley and Jane, however,\\r\\nsoon allowed the others to outstrip them.  They lagged behind,\\r\\nwhile Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.\\r\\nVery little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of\\r\\nhim to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate\\r\\nresolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call\\r\\nupon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a\\r\\ngeneral concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with\\r\\nhim alone.  Now was the moment for her resolution to be\\r\\nexecuted, and, while her courage was high, she immediately\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of\\r\\ngiving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be\\r\\nwounding your\\'s.  I can no longer help thanking you for your\\r\\nunexampled kindness to my poor sister.  Ever since I have known\\r\\nit, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how\\r\\ngratefully I feel it.  Were it known to the rest of my family,\\r\\nI should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of\\r\\nsurprise and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what\\r\\nmay, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.  I did not\\r\\nthink Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not blame my aunt.  Lydia\\'s thoughtlessness first\\r\\nbetrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and,\\r\\nof course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.  Let\\r\\nme thank you again and again, in the name of all my family,\\r\\nfor that generous compassion which induced you to take so much\\r\\ntrouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of\\r\\ndiscovering them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself\\r\\nalone.  That the wish of giving happiness to you might add\\r\\nforce to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not\\r\\nattempt to deny.  But your family owe me nothing.  Much as\\r\\nI respect them, I believe I thought only of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.  After a\\r\\nshort pause, her companion added, \"You are too generous to\\r\\ntrifle with me.  If your feelings are still what they were\\r\\nlast April, tell me so at once.  My affections and wishes\\r\\nare unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this\\r\\nsubject for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and\\r\\nanxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and\\r\\nimmediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand\\r\\nthat her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since\\r\\nthe period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with\\r\\ngratitude and pleasure his present assurances.  The happiness\\r\\nwhich this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\\r\\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as\\r\\nsensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be\\r\\nsupposed to do.  Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his\\r\\neye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt\\r\\ndelight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she\\r\\ncould not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings,\\r\\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\\r\\naffection every moment more valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction.  There was\\r\\ntoo much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to\\r\\nany other objects.  She soon learnt that they were indebted\\r\\nfor their present good understanding to the efforts of his\\r\\naunt, who did call on him in her return through London,\\r\\nand there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and\\r\\nthe substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling\\r\\nemphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her\\r\\nladyship\\'s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness\\r\\nand assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist\\r\\nher endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which\\r\\nshe had refused to give.  But, unluckily for her ladyship,\\r\\nits effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever\\r\\nallowed myself to hope before.  I knew enough of your\\r\\ndisposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely,\\r\\nirrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged\\r\\nit to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know\\r\\nenough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.\\r\\nAfter abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no\\r\\nscruple in abusing you to all your relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?  For, though\\r\\nyour accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises,\\r\\nmy behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest\\r\\nreproof.  It was unpardonable.  I cannot think of it without\\r\\nabhorrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to\\r\\nthat evening,\" said Elizabeth.  \"The conduct of neither, if\\r\\nstrictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we\\r\\nhave both, I hope, improved in civility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.  The recollection\\r\\nof what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions\\r\\nduring the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,\\r\\ninexpressibly painful to me.  Your reproof, so well applied, I\\r\\nshall never forget: ``had you behaved in a more gentleman-like\\r\\nmanner.\\'\\' Those were your words.  You know not, you can\\r\\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; -- though it was\\r\\nsome time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow\\r\\ntheir justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong\\r\\nan impression.  I had not the smallest idea of their being ever\\r\\nfelt in such a way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can easily believe it.  You thought me then devoid of\\r\\nevery proper feeling, I am sure you did.  The turn of your\\r\\ncountenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could\\r\\nnot have addressed you in any possible way that would induce\\r\\nyou to accept me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  do not repeat what I then said.  These recollections\\r\\nwill not do at all.  I assure you that I have long been most\\r\\nheartily ashamed of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy mentioned his letter.  \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon\\r\\nmake you think better of me?  Did you, on reading it, give any\\r\\ncredit to its contents?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how\\r\\ngradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain,\\r\\nbut it was necessary.  I hope you have destroyed the letter.\\r\\nThere was one part especially, the opening of it, which I\\r\\nshould dread your having the power of reading again.  I can\\r\\nremember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it\\r\\nessential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have\\r\\nboth reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they\\r\\nare not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself\\r\\nperfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was\\r\\nwritten in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end\\r\\nso.  The adieu is charity itself.  But think no more of the\\r\\nletter.  The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person\\r\\nwho received it, are now so widely different from what they\\r\\nwere then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it\\r\\nought to be forgotten.  You must learn some of my philosophy.\\r\\nThink only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.\\r\\nYour retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that\\r\\nthe contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but,\\r\\nwhat is much better, of innocence.  But with me, it is not\\r\\nso.  Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which\\r\\nought not, to be repelled.  I have been a selfish being all my\\r\\nlife, in practice, though not in principle.  As a child I was\\r\\ntaught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my\\r\\ntemper.  I was given good principles, but left to follow them\\r\\nin pride and conceit.  Unfortunately an only son (for many\\r\\nyears an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though\\r\\ngood themselves (my father, particularly, all that was\\r\\nbenevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me\\r\\nto be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own\\r\\nfamily circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to\\r\\nwish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth\\r\\ncompared with my own.  Such I was, from eight to eight and\\r\\ntwenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest,\\r\\nloveliest Elizabeth!  What do I not owe you!  You taught me a\\r\\nlesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.  By you,\\r\\nI was properly humbled.  I came to you without a doubt of my\\r\\nreception.  You shewed me how insufficient were all my\\r\\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I had.  What will you think of my vanity?  I believed\\r\\nyou to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally,\\r\\nI assure you.  I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits\\r\\nmight often lead me wrong.  How you must have hated me after\\r\\nthat evening?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hate you!  I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon\\r\\nbegan to take a proper direction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we\\r\\nmet at Pemberley.  You blamed me for coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being\\r\\nnoticed by you.  My conscience told me that I deserved no\\r\\nextraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect\\r\\nto receive more than my due.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to shew you, by every\\r\\ncivility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the\\r\\npast; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your\\r\\nill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been\\r\\nattended to.  How soon any other wishes introduced themselves\\r\\nI can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after\\r\\nI had seen you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then told her of Georgiana\\'s delight in her acquaintance,\\r\\nand of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which\\r\\nnaturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon\\r\\nlearnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in\\r\\nquest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn,\\r\\nand that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from\\r\\nno other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a\\r\\nsubject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy\\r\\nto know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining\\r\\ntheir watches, that it was time to be at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder\\r\\nwhich introduced the discussion of their affairs.  Darcy\\r\\nwas delighted with their engagement; his friend had given\\r\\nhim the earliest information of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.  When I went away, I felt that it would soon\\r\\nhappen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission.  I guessed as\\r\\nmuch.\"  And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it\\r\\nhad been pretty much the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he, \"I made a\\r\\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long\\r\\nago.  I told him of all that had occurred to make my former\\r\\ninterference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.  His\\r\\nsurprise was great.  He had never had the slightest suspicion.\\r\\nI told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in\\r\\nsupposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to\\r\\nhim; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her\\r\\nwas unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of\\r\\ndirecting his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she, \"when\\r\\nyou told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my\\r\\ninformation last spring?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the former.  I had narrowly observed her during the two\\r\\nvisits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her\\r\\naffection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate\\r\\nconviction to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It did.  Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.  His diffidence\\r\\nhad prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a\\r\\ncase, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy.  I was\\r\\nobliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not\\r\\nunjustly, offended him.  I could not allow myself to conceal\\r\\nthat your sister had been in town three months last winter,\\r\\nthat I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.  He was\\r\\nangry.  But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than\\r\\nhe remained in any doubt of your sister\\'s sentiments.  He has\\r\\nheartily forgiven me now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most\\r\\ndelightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was\\r\\ninvaluable; but she checked herself.  She remembered that he\\r\\nhad yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early\\r\\nto begin.  In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of\\r\\ncourse was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the\\r\\nconversation till they reached the house.  In the hall they\\r\\nparted.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 59\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a\\r\\nquestion which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she\\r\\nentered their room, and from all the others when they sat down\\r\\nto table.  She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered\\r\\nabout, till she was beyond her own knowledge.  She coloured as\\r\\nshe spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a\\r\\nsuspicion of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing\\r\\nextraordinary.  The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the\\r\\nunacknowledged were silent.  Darcy was not of a disposition in\\r\\nwhich happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and\\r\\nconfused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself\\r\\nto be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were\\r\\nother evils before her.  She anticipated what would be felt in\\r\\nthe family when her situation became known; she was aware that\\r\\nno one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others\\r\\nit was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence\\r\\nmight do away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane.  Though suspicion was\\r\\nvery far from Miss Bennet\\'s general habits, she was absolutely\\r\\nincredulous here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are joking, Lizzy.  This cannot be! -- engaged to\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  No, no, you shall not deceive me.  I know it\\r\\nto be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed!  My sole dependence was\\r\\non you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do\\r\\nnot.  Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.  I speak nothing but the\\r\\ntruth.  He still loves me, and we are engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at her doubtingly.  \"Oh, Lizzy!  it cannot be.\\r\\nI know how much you dislike him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know nothing of the matter.  That is all to be forgot.\\r\\nPerhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.  But in\\r\\nsuch cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.  This is\\r\\nthe last time I shall ever remember it myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement.  Elizabeth again, and\\r\\nmore seriously assured her of its truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven!  can it be really so!  Yet now I must believe\\r\\nyou,\" cried Jane.  \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would -- I do\\r\\ncongratulate you -- but are you certain?  forgive the question\\r\\n-- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There can be no doubt of that.  It is settled between us\\r\\nalready, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.\\r\\nBut are you pleased, Jane?  Shall you like to have such a\\r\\nbrother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very, very much.  Nothing could give either Bingley or\\r\\nmyself more delight.  But we considered it, we talked of it as\\r\\nimpossible.  And do you really love him quite well enough?\\r\\nOh, Lizzy!  do any thing rather than marry without affection.\\r\\nAre you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  You will only think I feel more than I ought to\\r\\ndo, when I tell you all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.\\r\\nI am afraid you will be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest sister, now be serious.  I want to talk very\\r\\nseriously.  Let me know every thing that I am to know, without\\r\\ndelay.  Will you tell me how long you have loved him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it\\r\\nbegan.  But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his\\r\\nbeautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced\\r\\nthe desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn\\r\\nassurances of attachment.  When convinced on that article, Miss\\r\\nBennet had nothing farther to wish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as\\r\\nmyself.  I always had a value for him.  Were it for nothing but\\r\\nhis love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as\\r\\nBingley\\'s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley\\r\\nand yourself more dear to me.  But Lizzy, you have been very\\r\\nsly, very reserved with me.  How little did you tell me of what\\r\\npassed at Pemberley and Lambton!  I owe all that I know of it\\r\\nto another, not to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.  She had been\\r\\nunwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her\\r\\nown feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.\\r\\nBut now she would no longer conceal from her his share in\\r\\nLydia\\'s marriage.  All was acknowledged, and half the night\\r\\nspent in conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window\\r\\nthe next morning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming\\r\\nhere again with our dear Bingley!  What can he mean by being so\\r\\ntiresome as to be always coming here?  I had no notion but he\\r\\nwould go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us\\r\\nwith his company.  What shall we do with him?  Lizzy, you must\\r\\nwalk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\\'s way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a\\r\\nproposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be\\r\\nalways giving him such an epithet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,\\r\\nand shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good\\r\\ninformation; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\nhave you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her\\r\\nway again to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.  It is a nice long walk,\\r\\nand Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but\\r\\nI am sure it will be too much for Kitty.  Won\\'t it, Kitty?\"\\r\\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home.  Darcy professed\\r\\na great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth\\r\\nsilently consented.  As she went up stairs to get ready,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet followed her, saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have\\r\\nthat disagreeable man all to yourself.  But I hope you will not\\r\\nmind it: it is all for Jane\\'s sake, you know; and there is no\\r\\noccasion for talking to him, except just now and then.  So, do\\r\\nnot put yourself to inconvenience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\\'s consent\\r\\nshould be asked in the course of the evening.  Elizabeth\\r\\nreserved to herself the application for her mother\\'s.  She\\r\\ncould not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes\\r\\ndoubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough\\r\\nto overcome her abhorrence of the man.  But whether she were\\r\\nviolently set against the match, or violently delighted with\\r\\nit, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted\\r\\nto do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that\\r\\nMr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the\\r\\nfirst vehemence of her disapprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,\\r\\nshe saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation\\r\\non seeing it was extreme.  She did not fear her father\\'s\\r\\nopposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it\\r\\nshould be through her means -- that she, his favourite child,\\r\\nshould be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him\\r\\nwith fears and regrets in disposing of her -- was a wretched\\r\\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared\\r\\nagain, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his\\r\\nsmile.  In a few minutes he approached the table where she was\\r\\nsitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work\\r\\nsaid in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he wants you in the\\r\\nlibrary.\"  She was gone directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and\\r\\nanxious.  \"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing?  Are you out\\r\\nof your senses, to be accepting this man?  Have not you always\\r\\nhated him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had\\r\\nbeen more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!  It would\\r\\nhave spared her from explanations and professions which it was\\r\\nexceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and\\r\\nshe assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to\\r\\nMr. Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.  He is\\r\\nrich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine\\r\\ncarriages than Jane.  But will they make you happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your\\r\\nbelief of my indifference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None at all.  We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort\\r\\nof man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes,\\r\\n\"I love him.  Indeed he has no improper pride.  He is perfectly\\r\\namiable.  You do not know what he really is; then pray do not\\r\\npain me by speaking of him in such terms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent.\\r\\nHe is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare\\r\\nrefuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.  I now give it\\r\\nto you, if you are resolved on having him.  But let me advise\\r\\nyou to think better of it.  I know your disposition, Lizzy.\\r\\nI know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless\\r\\nyou truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him\\r\\nas a superior.  Your lively talents would place you in the\\r\\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage.  You could scarcely\\r\\nescape discredit and misery.  My child, let me not have the\\r\\ngrief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life.\\r\\nYou know not what you are about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her\\r\\nreply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was\\r\\nreally the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual\\r\\nchange which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her\\r\\nabsolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a\\r\\nday, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and\\r\\nenumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer\\r\\nher father\\'s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no\\r\\nmore to say.  If this be the case, he deserves you.  I could\\r\\nnot have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what\\r\\nMr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.  He heard her with\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!  And so, Darcy did\\r\\nevery thing: made up the match, gave the money, paid the\\r\\nfellow\\'s debts, and got him his commission!  So much the\\r\\nbetter.  It will save me a world of trouble and economy.\\r\\nHad it been your uncle\\'s doing, I must and would have paid\\r\\nhim; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their\\r\\nown way.  I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant\\r\\nand storm about his love for you, and there will be an end\\r\\nof the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his\\r\\nreading Mr. Collins\\'s letter; and after laughing at her some\\r\\ntime, allowed her at last to go -- saying, as she quitted the\\r\\nroom, \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in,\\r\\nfor I am quite at leisure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight;\\r\\nand, after half an hour\\'s quiet reflection in her own room,\\r\\nshe was able to join the others with tolerable composure.\\r\\nEvery thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed\\r\\ntranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to\\r\\nbe dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would\\r\\ncome in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she\\r\\nfollowed her, and made the important communication.  Its effect\\r\\nwas most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.  Nor was it\\r\\nunder many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she\\r\\nheard; though not in general backward to credit what was for\\r\\nthe advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\\r\\nlover to any of them.  She began at length to recover, to\\r\\nfidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder,\\r\\nand bless herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Lord bless me!  only think!  dear me!\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  Who would have thought it!  And is it really true?\\r\\nOh!  my sweetest Lizzy!  how rich and how great you will be!\\r\\nWhat pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!\\r\\nJane\\'s is nothing to it -- nothing at all.  I am so pleased --\\r\\nso happy.  Such a charming man! -- so handsome!  so tall! --\\r\\nOh, my dear Lizzy!  pray apologise for my having disliked him\\r\\nso much before.  I hope he will overlook it.  Dear, dear Lizzy.\\r\\nA house in town!  Every thing that is charming!  Three\\r\\ndaughters married!  Ten thousand a year!  Oh, Lord!  What will\\r\\nbecome of me.  I shall go distracted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be\\r\\ndoubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was\\r\\nheard only by herself, soon went away.  But before she had\\r\\nbeen three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else!\\r\\nTen thousand a year, and very likely more!  \\'Tis as good as a\\r\\nLord!  And a special licence.  You must and shall be married\\r\\nby a special licence.  But my dearest love, tell me what dish\\r\\nMr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it\\r\\ntomorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother\\'s behaviour to the\\r\\ngentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in\\r\\nthe certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of\\r\\nher relations\\' consent, there was still something to be wished\\r\\nfor.  But the morrow passed off much better than she expected;\\r\\nfor Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended\\r\\nson-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was\\r\\nin her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference\\r\\nfor his opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking\\r\\npains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured\\r\\nher that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he.\\r\\n\"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall\\r\\nlike your husband quite as well as Jane\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 60\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH\\'S spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she\\r\\nwanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love\\r\\nwith her.  \"How could you begin?\" said she.  \"I can comprehend\\r\\nyour going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning;\\r\\nbut what could set you off in the first place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the\\r\\nwords, which laid the foundation.  It is too long ago.  I was\\r\\nin the middle before I knew that I had begun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners --\\r\\nmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the\\r\\nuncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to\\r\\ngive you pain than not.  Now be sincere; did you admire me for\\r\\nmy impertinence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once.  It was very\\r\\nlittle less.  The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of\\r\\ndeference, of officious attention.  You were disgusted with the\\r\\nwomen who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for\\r\\nyour approbation alone.  I roused, and interested you,\\r\\nbecause I was so unlike them.  Had you not been really\\r\\namiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the\\r\\npains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always\\r\\nnoble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the\\r\\npersons who so assiduously courted you.  There -- I have saved\\r\\nyou the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things\\r\\nconsidered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.  To be\\r\\nsure, you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of\\r\\nthat when they fall in love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while\\r\\nshe was ill at Netherfield?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dearest Jane!  who could have done less for her?  But make a\\r\\nvirtue of it by all means.  My good qualities are under your\\r\\nprotection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;\\r\\nand, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing\\r\\nand quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin\\r\\ndirectly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to\\r\\nthe point at last.  What made you so shy of me, when you first\\r\\ncalled, and afterwards dined here?  Why, especially, when you\\r\\ncalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no\\r\\nencouragement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so was I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,\\r\\nand that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!  But I\\r\\nwonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left\\r\\nto yourself.  I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had\\r\\nnot asked you!  My resolution of thanking you for your kindness\\r\\nto Lydia had certainly great effect.  Too much, I am\\r\\nafraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs\\r\\nfrom a breach of promise?  for I ought not to have mentioned\\r\\nthe subject.  This will never do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not distress yourself.  The moral will be perfectly\\r\\nfair.  Lady Catherine\\'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us\\r\\nwere the means of removing all my doubts.  I am not indebted\\r\\nfor my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing\\r\\nyour gratitude.  I was not in a humour to wait for any opening\\r\\nof your\\'s.  My aunt\\'s intelligence had given me hope, and I was\\r\\ndetermined at once to know every thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make\\r\\nher happy, for she loves to be of use.  But tell me, what did\\r\\nyou come down to Netherfield for?  Was it merely to ride to\\r\\nLongbourn and be embarrassed?  or had you intended any more\\r\\nserious consequence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could,\\r\\nwhether I might ever hope to make you love me.  My avowed one,\\r\\nor what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were\\r\\nstill partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the\\r\\nconfession to him which I have since made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine\\r\\nwhat is to befall her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth.\\r\\nBut it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper,\\r\\nit shall be done directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you\\r\\nand admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady\\r\\nonce did.  But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer\\r\\nneglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with\\r\\nMr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet\\r\\nanswered Mrs. Gardiner\\'s long letter; but now, having that\\r\\nto communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was\\r\\nalmost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost\\r\\nthree days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought\\r\\nto have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of\\r\\nparticulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.\\r\\nYou supposed more than really existed.  But now suppose as\\r\\nmuch as you choose; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your\\r\\nimagination in every possible flight which the subject will\\r\\nafford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot\\r\\ngreatly err.  You must write again very soon, and praise him a\\r\\ngreat deal more than you did in your last.  I thank you, again\\r\\nand again, for not going to the Lakes.  How could I be so silly\\r\\nas to wish it!  Your idea of the ponies is delightful.  We will\\r\\ngo round the Park every day.  I am the happiest creature in the\\r\\nworld.  Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one\\r\\nwith such justice.  I am happier even than Jane; she only\\r\\nsmiles, I laugh.  Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world\\r\\nthat he can spare from me.  You are all to come to Pemberley at\\r\\nChristmas.  Your\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;\\r\\nand still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to\\r\\nMr. Collins, in reply to his last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\r\\n\\r\\nI must trouble you once more for congratulations.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwill soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.  Console Lady Catherine\\r\\nas well as you can.  But, if I were you, I would stand by the\\r\\nnephew.  He has more to give.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s sincerely, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s congratulations to her brother, on his\\r\\napproaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and\\r\\ninsincere.  She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express\\r\\nher delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.\\r\\nJane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling\\r\\nno reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder\\r\\nanswer than she knew was deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar\\r\\ninformation, was as sincere as her brother\\'s in sending it.\\r\\nFour sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her\\r\\ndelight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any\\r\\ncongratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn\\r\\nfamily heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas\\r\\nlodge.  The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.\\r\\nLady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by\\r\\nthe contents of her nephew\\'s letter, that Charlotte, really\\r\\nrejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the\\r\\nstorm was blown over.  At such a moment, the arrival of\\r\\nher friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in\\r\\nthe course of their meetings she must sometimes think the\\r\\npleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all\\r\\nthe parading and obsequious civility of her husband.  He bore\\r\\nit, however, with admirable calmness.  He could even listen to\\r\\nSir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\\r\\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of\\r\\ntheir all meeting frequently at St. James\\'s, with very decent\\r\\ncomposure.  If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir\\r\\nWilliam was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips\\'s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater,\\r\\ntax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as\\r\\nher sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the\\r\\nfamiliarity which Bingley\\'s good humour encouraged, yet,\\r\\nwhenever she did speak, she must be vulgar.  Nor was her\\r\\nrespect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely\\r\\nto make her more elegant.  Elizabeth did all she could to\\r\\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever\\r\\nanxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with\\r\\nwhom he might converse without mortification; and though the\\r\\nuncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the\\r\\nseason of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope\\r\\nof the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time\\r\\nwhen they should be removed from society so little pleasing to\\r\\neither, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party\\r\\nat Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 61\\r\\n\\r\\nHAPPY for all her maternal feelings was the day on which\\r\\nMrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\r\\nWith what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley,\\r\\nand talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.  I wish I could say,\\r\\nfor the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her\\r\\nearnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children\\r\\nproduced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,\\r\\nwell-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it\\r\\nwas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic\\r\\nfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally\\r\\nnervous and invariably silly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his\\r\\naffection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing\\r\\nelse could do.  He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially\\r\\nwhen he was least expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a\\r\\ntwelvemonth.  So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton\\r\\nrelations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her\\r\\naffectionate heart.  The darling wish of his sisters was then\\r\\ngratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to\\r\\nDerbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other\\r\\nsource of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her\\r\\ntime with her two elder sisters.  In society so superior to\\r\\nwhat she had generally known, her improvement was great.  She\\r\\nwas not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from\\r\\nthe influence of Lydia\\'s example, she became, by proper\\r\\nattention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and\\r\\nless insipid.  From the farther disadvantage of Lydia\\'s society\\r\\nshe was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\\r\\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the\\r\\npromise of balls and young men, her father would never consent\\r\\nto her going.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was\\r\\nnecessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s being quite unable to sit alone.  Mary was\\r\\nobliged to mix more with the world, but she could still\\r\\nmoralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer\\r\\nmortified by comparisons between her sisters\\' beauty and her\\r\\nown, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to\\r\\nthe change without much reluctance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no\\r\\nrevolution from the marriage of her sisters.  He bore with\\r\\nphilosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become\\r\\nacquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood\\r\\nhad before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing,\\r\\nwas not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed\\r\\non to make his fortune.  The congratulatory letter which\\r\\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to\\r\\nher that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a\\r\\nhope was cherished.  The letter was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish you joy.  If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my\\r\\ndear Wickham, you must be very happy.  It is a great comfort to\\r\\nhave you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope\\r\\nyou will think of us.  I am sure Wickham would like a place at\\r\\ncourt very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money\\r\\nenough to live upon without some help.  Any place would do, of\\r\\nabout three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak\\r\\nto Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she\\r\\nendeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty\\r\\nand expectation of the kind.  Such relief, however, as it\\r\\nwas in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be\\r\\ncalled economy in her own private expences, she frequently\\r\\nsent them.  It had always been evident to her that such an\\r\\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so\\r\\nextravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must\\r\\nbe very insufficient to their support; and whenever they\\r\\nchanged their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of\\r\\nbeing applied to for some little assistance towards discharging\\r\\ntheir bills.  Their manner of living, even when the restoration\\r\\nof peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\\r\\nextreme.  They were always moving from place to place in quest\\r\\nof a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.\\r\\nHis affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her\\'s lasted\\r\\na little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she\\r\\nretained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had\\r\\ngiven her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.\\r\\nLydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was\\r\\ngone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys\\r\\nthey both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley\\'s\\r\\ngood humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk\\r\\nof giving them a hint to be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\\'s marriage; but\\r\\nas she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at\\r\\nPemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever\\r\\nof Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and\\r\\npaid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nPemberley was now Georgiana\\'s home; and the attachment of the\\r\\nsisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.  They were\\r\\nable to love each other even as well as they intended.\\r\\nGeorgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;\\r\\nthough at first she often listened with an astonishment\\r\\nbordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking\\r\\nto her brother.  He, who had always inspired in herself a\\r\\nrespect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the\\r\\nobject of open pleasantry.  Her mind received knowledge which\\r\\nhad never before fallen in her way.  By Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\ninstructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take\\r\\nliberties with her husband which a brother will not always\\r\\nallow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her\\r\\nnephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her\\r\\ncharacter in her reply to the letter which announced its\\r\\narrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially\\r\\nof Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.\\r\\nBut at length, by Elizabeth\\'s persuasion, he was prevailed on\\r\\nto overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after\\r\\na little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her\\r\\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her\\r\\ncuriosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she\\r\\ncondescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that\\r\\npollution which its woods had received, not merely from the\\r\\npresence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and\\r\\naunt from the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate\\r\\nterms.  Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and\\r\\nthey were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards\\r\\nthe persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the\\r\\nmeans of uniting them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

You are this day 55. If a woman\\r\\nmay ever be said to be in safety from the determined Perseverance of\\r\\ndisagreeable Lovers and the cruel Persecutions of obstinate Fathers,\\r\\nsurely it must be at such a time of Life. Isabel\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER 2nd LAURA to ISABEL\\r\\n\\r\\nAltho' I cannot agree with you in supposing that I shall never again be\\r\\nexposed to Misfortunes as unmerited as those I have already experienced,\\r\\nyet to avoid the imputation of Obstinacy or ill-nature, I will gratify\\r\\nthe curiosity of your daughter; and may the fortitude with which I have\\r\\nsuffered the many afflictions of my past Life, prove to her a useful\\r\\nlesson for the support of those which may befall her in her own. Laura\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER 3rd LAURA to MARIANNE\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Daughter of my most intimate freind I think you entitled to that\\r\\nknowledge of my unhappy story, which your Mother has so often solicited\\r\\nme to give you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Father was a native of Ireland and an inhabitant of Wales; my Mother\\r\\nwas the natural Daughter of a Scotch Peer by an italian Opera-girl--I\\r\\nwas born in Spain and received my Education at a Convent in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had reached my eighteenth Year I was recalled by my Parents to\\r\\nmy paternal roof in Wales. Our mansion was situated in one of the most\\r\\nromantic parts of the Vale of Uske. Tho' my Charms are now considerably\\r\\nsoftened and somewhat impaired by the Misfortunes I have undergone, I\\r\\nwas once beautiful. But lovely as I was the Graces of my Person were the\\r\\nleast of my Perfections. Of every accomplishment accustomary to my sex,\\r\\nI was Mistress. When in the Convent, my progress had always exceeded my\\r\\ninstructions, my Acquirements had been wonderfull for my age, and I had\\r\\nshortly surpassed my Masters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my Mind, every Virtue that could adorn it was centered; it was the\\r\\nRendez-vous of every good Quality and of every noble sentiment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sensibility too tremblingly alive to every affliction of my Freinds,\\r\\nmy Acquaintance and particularly to every affliction of my own, was my\\r\\nonly fault, if a fault it could be called. Alas! how altered now! Tho'\\r\\nindeed my own Misfortunes do not make less impression on me than they\\r\\never did, yet now I never feel for those of an other. My accomplishments\\r\\ntoo, begin to fade--I can neither sing so well nor Dance so gracefully\\r\\nas I once did--and I have entirely forgot the MINUET DELA COUR. Adeiu.\\r\\nLaura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER 4th Laura to MARIANNE\\r\\n\\r\\nOur neighbourhood was small, for it consisted only of your Mother. She\\r\\nmay probably have already told you that being left by her Parents\\r\\nin indigent Circumstances she had retired into Wales on eoconomical\\r\\nmotives. There it was our freindship first commenced. Isobel was then\\r\\none and twenty. Tho' pleasing both in her Person and Manners (between\\r\\nourselves) she never possessed the hundredth part of my Beauty or\\r\\nAccomplishments. Isabel had seen the World. She had passed 2 Years at\\r\\none of the first Boarding-schools in London; had spent a fortnight in\\r\\nBath and had supped one night in Southampton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeware my Laura (she would often say) Beware of the insipid Vanities\\r\\nand idle Dissipations of the Metropolis of England; Beware of the\\r\\nunmeaning Luxuries of Bath and of the stinking fish of Southampton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlas! (exclaimed I) how am I to avoid those evils I shall never\\r\\nbe exposed to? What probability is there of my ever tasting the\\r\\nDissipations of London, the Luxuries of Bath, or the stinking Fish of\\r\\nSouthampton? I who am doomed to waste my Days of Youth and Beauty in an\\r\\nhumble Cottage in the Vale of Uske.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! little did I then think I was ordained so soon to quit that humble\\r\\nCottage for the Deceitfull Pleasures of the World. Adeiu Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER 5th LAURA to MARIANNE\\r\\n\\r\\nOne Evening in December as my Father, my Mother and myself, were\\r\\narranged in social converse round our Fireside, we were on a sudden\\r\\ngreatly astonished, by hearing a violent knocking on the outward door of\\r\\nour rustic Cot.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Father started--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat noise is that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (said he.) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt sounds like a\\r\\nloud rapping at the door\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--(replied my Mother.) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit does indeed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (cried\\r\\nI.) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am of your opinion; (said my Father) it certainly does appear\\r\\nto proceed from some uncommon violence exerted against our unoffending\\r\\ndoor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes (exclaimed I) I cannot help thinking it must be somebody who\\r\\nknocks for admittance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is another point (replied he;) We must not pretend to determine\\r\\non what motive the person may knock--tho' that someone DOES rap at the\\r\\ndoor, I am partly convinced.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, a 2d tremendous rap interrupted my Father in his speech, and\\r\\nsomewhat alarmed my Mother and me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHad we better not go and see who it is? (said she) the servants are\\r\\nout.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we had.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (replied I.) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly, (added my Father)\\r\\nby all means.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall we go now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (said my Mother,) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe sooner the\\r\\nbetter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (answered he.) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! let no time be lost\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (cried I.)\\r\\n\\r\\nA third more violent Rap than ever again assaulted our ears. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\ncertain there is somebody knocking at the Door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (said my Mother.)\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think there must,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (replied my Father) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI fancy the servants are\\r\\nreturned; (said I) I think I hear Mary going to the Door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI'm glad of\\r\\nit (cried my Father) for I long to know who it is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was right in my conjecture; for Mary instantly entering the Room,\\r\\ninformed us that a young Gentleman and his Servant were at the door, who\\r\\nhad lossed their way, were very cold and begged leave to warm themselves\\r\\nby our fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWon't you admit them?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (said I.) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have no objection, my Dear?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n (said my Father.) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNone in the World.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (replied my Mother.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, without waiting for any further commands immediately left the room\\r\\nand quickly returned introducing the most beauteous and amiable Youth, I\\r\\nhad ever beheld. The servant she kept to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy natural sensibility had already been greatly affected by the\\r\\nsufferings of the unfortunate stranger and no sooner did I first behold\\r\\nhim, than I felt that on him the happiness or Misery of my future Life\\r\\nmust depend. Adeiu Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER 6th LAURA to MARIANNE\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noble Youth informed us that his name was Lindsay--for particular\\r\\nreasons however I shall conceal it under that of Talbot. He told us that\\r\\nhe was the son of an English Baronet, that his Mother had been for many\\r\\nyears no more and that he had a Sister of the middle size. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Father\\r\\n(he continued) is a mean and mercenary wretch--it is only to such\\r\\nparticular freinds as this Dear Party that I would thus betray his\\r\\nfailings. Your Virtues my amiable Polydore (addressing himself to my\\r\\nfather) yours Dear Claudia and yours my Charming Laura call on me to\\r\\nrepose in you, my confidence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d We bowed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Father seduced by the false\\r\\nglare of Fortune and the Deluding Pomp of Title, insisted on my giving\\r\\nmy hand to Lady Dorothea. No never exclaimed I. Lady Dorothea is lovely\\r\\nand Engaging; I prefer no woman to her; but know Sir, that I scorn to\\r\\nmarry her in compliance with your Wishes. No! Never shall it be said\\r\\nthat I obliged my Father.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all admired the noble Manliness of his reply. He continued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Edward was surprised; he had perhaps little expected to meet with\\r\\nso spirited an opposition to his will. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere, Edward in the name of\\r\\nwonder (said he) did you pick up this unmeaning gibberish? You have\\r\\nbeen studying Novels I suspect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I scorned to answer: it would have\\r\\nbeen beneath my dignity. I mounted my Horse and followed by my faithful\\r\\nWilliam set forth for my Aunts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Father's house is situated in Bedfordshire, my Aunt's in Middlesex,\\r\\nand tho' I flatter myself with being a tolerable proficient in\\r\\nGeography, I know not how it happened, but I found myself entering this\\r\\nbeautifull Vale which I find is in South Wales, when I had expected to\\r\\nhave reached my Aunts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter having wandered some time on the Banks of the Uske without\\r\\nknowing which way to go, I began to lament my cruel Destiny in the\\r\\nbitterest and most pathetic Manner. It was now perfectly dark, not a\\r\\nsingle star was there to direct my steps, and I know not what might have\\r\\nbefallen me had I not at length discerned thro' the solemn Gloom that\\r\\nsurrounded me a distant light, which as I approached it, I discovered\\r\\nto be the chearfull Blaze of your fire. Impelled by the combination\\r\\nof Misfortunes under which I laboured, namely Fear, Cold and Hunger I\\r\\nhesitated not to ask admittance which at length I have gained; and\\r\\nnow my Adorable Laura (continued he taking my Hand) when may I hope\\r\\nto receive that reward of all the painfull sufferings I have undergone\\r\\nduring the course of my attachment to you, to which I have ever aspired.\\r\\nOh! when will you reward me with Yourself?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis instant, Dear and Amiable Edward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (replied I.). We were\\r\\nimmediately united by my Father, who tho' he had never taken orders had\\r\\nbeen bred to the Church. Adeiu Laura\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER 7th LAURA to MARIANNE\\r\\n\\r\\nWe remained but a few days after our Marriage, in the Vale of Uske.\\r\\nAfter taking an affecting Farewell of my Father, my Mother and my\\r\\nIsabel, I accompanied Edward to his Aunt's in Middlesex. Philippa\\r\\nreceived us both with every expression of affectionate Love. My arrival\\r\\nwas indeed a most agreable surprise to her as she had not only been\\r\\ntotally ignorant of my Marriage with her Nephew, but had never even had\\r\\nthe slightest idea of there being such a person in the World.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugusta, the sister of Edward was on a visit to her when we arrived.\\r\\nI found her exactly what her Brother had described her to be--of the\\r\\nmiddle size. She received me with equal surprise though not with equal\\r\\nCordiality, as Philippa. There was a disagreable coldness and Forbidding\\r\\nReserve in her reception of me which was equally distressing and\\r\\nUnexpected. None of that interesting Sensibility or amiable simpathy\\r\\nin her manners and Address to me when we first met which should have\\r\\ndistinguished our introduction to each other. Her Language was neither\\r\\nwarm, nor affectionate, her expressions of regard were neither animated\\r\\nnor cordial; her arms were not opened to receive me to her Heart, tho'\\r\\nmy own were extended to press her to mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short Conversation between Augusta and her Brother, which I\\r\\naccidentally overheard encreased my dislike to her, and convinced me\\r\\nthat her Heart was no more formed for the soft ties of Love than for the\\r\\nendearing intercourse of Freindship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut do you think that my Father will ever be reconciled to this\\r\\nimprudent connection?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (said Augusta.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAugusta (replied the noble Youth) I thought you had a better opinion of\\r\\nme, than to imagine I would so abjectly degrade myself as to consider\\r\\nmy Father's Concurrence in any of my affairs, either of Consequence\\r\\nor concern to me. Tell me Augusta with sincerity; did you ever know\\r\\nme consult his inclinations or follow his Advice in the least trifling\\r\\nParticular since the age of fifteen?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEdward (replied she) you are surely too diffident in your own praise.\\r\\nSince you were fifteen only! My Dear Brother since you were five years\\r\\nold, I entirely acquit you of ever having willingly contributed to the\\r\\nsatisfaction of your Father. But still I am not without apprehensions\\r\\nof your being shortly obliged to degrade yourself in your own eyes by\\r\\nseeking a support for your wife in the Generosity of Sir Edward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever, never Augusta will I so demean myself. (said Edward). Support!\\r\\nWhat support will Laura want which she can receive from him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly those very insignificant ones of Victuals and Drink.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (answered\\r\\nshe.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVictuals and Drink! (replied my Husband in a most nobly contemptuous\\r\\nManner) and dost thou then imagine that there is no other support for\\r\\nan exalted mind (such as is my Laura's) than the mean and indelicate\\r\\nemployment of Eating and Drinking?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNone that I know of, so efficacious.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (returned Augusta).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd did you then never feel the pleasing Pangs of Love, Augusta?\\r\\n(replied my Edward). Does it appear impossible to your vile and\\r\\ncorrupted Palate, to exist on Love? Can you not conceive the Luxury of\\r\\nliving in every distress that Poverty can inflict, with the object of\\r\\nyour tenderest affection?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are too ridiculous (said Augusta) to argue with; perhaps however\\r\\nyou may in time be convinced that...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere I was prevented from hearing the remainder of her speech, by the\\r\\nappearance of a very Handsome young Woman, who was ushured into the Room\\r\\nat the Door of which I had been listening. On hearing her announced by\\r\\nthe Name of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLady Dorothea,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I instantly quitted my Post and followed\\r\\nher into the Parlour, for I well remembered that she was the Lady,\\r\\nproposed as a Wife for my Edward by the Cruel and Unrelenting Baronet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAltho' Lady Dorothea's visit was nominally to Philippa and Augusta, yet\\r\\nI have some reason to imagine that (acquainted with the Marriage and\\r\\narrival of Edward) to see me was a principal motive to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon perceived that tho' Lovely and Elegant in her Person and tho'\\r\\nEasy and Polite in her Address, she was of that inferior order of\\r\\nBeings with regard to Delicate Feeling, tender Sentiments, and refined\\r\\nSensibility, of which Augusta was one.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe staid but half an hour and neither in the Course of her Visit,\\r\\nconfided to me any of her secret thoughts, nor requested me to confide\\r\\nin her, any of Mine. You will easily imagine therefore my Dear Marianne\\r\\nthat I could not feel any ardent affection or very sincere Attachment\\r\\nfor Lady Dorothea. Adeiu Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER 8th LAURA to MARIANNE, in continuation\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Dorothea had not left us long before another visitor as unexpected\\r\\na one as her Ladyship, was announced. It was Sir Edward, who informed\\r\\nby Augusta of her Brother's marriage, came doubtless to reproach him for\\r\\nhaving dared to unite himself to me without his Knowledge. But Edward\\r\\nforeseeing his design, approached him with heroic fortitude as soon as\\r\\nhe entered the Room, and addressed him in the following Manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Edward, I know the motive of your Journey here--You come with the\\r\\nbase Design of reproaching me for having entered into an indissoluble\\r\\nengagement with my Laura without your Consent. But Sir, I glory in the\\r\\nAct--. It is my greatest boast that I have incurred the displeasure of\\r\\nmy Father!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, he took my hand and whilst Sir Edward, Philippa, and Augusta\\r\\nwere doubtless reflecting with admiration on his undaunted Bravery, led\\r\\nme from the Parlour to his Father's Carriage which yet remained at the\\r\\nDoor and in which we were instantly conveyed from the pursuit of Sir\\r\\nEdward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Postilions had at first received orders only to take the London\\r\\nroad; as soon as we had sufficiently reflected However, we ordered them\\r\\nto Drive to M----. the seat of Edward's most particular freind, which\\r\\nwas but a few miles distant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt M----. we arrived in a few hours; and on sending in our names were\\r\\nimmediately admitted to Sophia, the Wife of Edward's freind. After\\r\\nhaving been deprived during the course of 3 weeks of a real freind (for\\r\\nsuch I term your Mother) imagine my transports at beholding one, most\\r\\ntruly worthy of the Name. Sophia was rather above the middle size; most\\r\\nelegantly formed. A soft languor spread over her lovely features, but\\r\\nincreased their Beauty--. It was the Charectarestic of her Mind--. She\\r\\nwas all sensibility and Feeling. We flew into each others arms and after\\r\\nhaving exchanged vows of mutual Freindship for the rest of our Lives,\\r\\ninstantly unfolded to each other the most inward secrets of our\\r\\nHearts--. We were interrupted in the delightfull Employment by the\\r\\nentrance of Augustus, (Edward's freind) who was just returned from a\\r\\nsolitary ramble.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever did I see such an affecting Scene as was the meeting of Edward and\\r\\nAugustus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Life! my Soul!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (exclaimed the former) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy adorable angel!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (replied\\r\\nthe latter) as they flew into each other's arms. It was too pathetic\\r\\nfor the feelings of Sophia and myself--We fainted alternately on a sofa.\\r\\nAdeiu Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the 9th From the same to the same\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the close of the day we received the following Letter from\\r\\nPhilippa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Edward is greatly incensed by your abrupt departure; he has\\r\\ntaken back Augusta to Bedfordshire. Much as I wish to enjoy again your\\r\\ncharming society, I cannot determine to snatch you from that, of such\\r\\ndear and deserving Freinds--When your Visit to them is terminated, I\\r\\ntrust you will return to the arms of your\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPhilippa.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned a suitable answer to this affectionate Note and after\\r\\nthanking her for her kind invitation assured her that we would certainly\\r\\navail ourselves of it, whenever we might have no other place to go to.\\r\\nTho' certainly nothing could to any reasonable Being, have appeared more\\r\\nsatisfactory, than so gratefull a reply to her invitation, yet I know\\r\\nnot how it was, but she was certainly capricious enough to be displeased\\r\\nwith our behaviour and in a few weeks after, either to revenge our\\r\\nConduct, or releive her own solitude, married a young and illiterate\\r\\nFortune-hunter. This imprudent step (tho' we were sensible that it would\\r\\nprobably deprive us of that fortune which Philippa had ever taught us to\\r\\nexpect) could not on our own accounts, excite from our exalted minds a\\r\\nsingle sigh; yet fearfull lest it might prove a source of endless misery\\r\\nto the deluded Bride, our trembling Sensibility was greatly affected\\r\\nwhen we were first informed of the Event. The affectionate Entreaties of\\r\\nAugustus and Sophia that we would for ever consider their House as our\\r\\nHome, easily prevailed on us to determine never more to leave them, In\\r\\nthe society of my Edward and this Amiable Pair, I passed the happiest\\r\\nmoments of my Life; Our time was most delightfully spent, in mutual\\r\\nProtestations of Freindship, and in vows of unalterable Love, in which\\r\\nwe were secure from being interrupted, by intruding and disagreable\\r\\nVisitors, as Augustus and Sophia had on their first Entrance in the\\r\\nNeighbourhood, taken due care to inform the surrounding Families, that\\r\\nas their happiness centered wholly in themselves, they wished for no\\r\\nother society. But alas! my Dear Marianne such Happiness as I then\\r\\nenjoyed was too perfect to be lasting. A most severe and unexpected Blow\\r\\nat once destroyed every sensation of Pleasure. Convinced as you must be\\r\\nfrom what I have already told you concerning Augustus and Sophia, that\\r\\nthere never were a happier Couple, I need not I imagine, inform you that\\r\\ntheir union had been contrary to the inclinations of their Cruel\\r\\nand Mercenery Parents; who had vainly endeavoured with obstinate\\r\\nPerseverance to force them into a Marriage with those whom they had ever\\r\\nabhorred; but with a Heroic Fortitude worthy to be related and admired,\\r\\nthey had both, constantly refused to submit to such despotic Power.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having so nobly disentangled themselves from the shackles of\\r\\nParental Authority, by a Clandestine Marriage, they were determined\\r\\nnever to forfeit the good opinion they had gained in the World, in\\r\\nso doing, by accepting any proposals of reconciliation that might be\\r\\noffered them by their Fathers--to this farther tryal of their noble\\r\\nindependance however they never were exposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had been married but a few months when our visit to them commenced\\r\\nduring which time they had been amply supported by a considerable sum of\\r\\nmoney which Augustus had gracefully purloined from his unworthy father's\\r\\nEscritoire, a few days before his union with Sophia.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy our arrival their Expenses were considerably encreased tho' their\\r\\nmeans for supplying them were then nearly exhausted. But they, Exalted\\r\\nCreatures! scorned to reflect a moment on their pecuniary Distresses and\\r\\nwould have blushed at the idea of paying their Debts.--Alas! what was\\r\\ntheir Reward for such disinterested Behaviour! The beautifull Augustus\\r\\nwas arrested and we were all undone. Such perfidious Treachery in the\\r\\nmerciless perpetrators of the Deed will shock your gentle nature Dearest\\r\\nMarianne as much as it then affected the Delicate sensibility of\\r\\nEdward, Sophia, your Laura, and of Augustus himself. To compleat such\\r\\nunparalelled Barbarity we were informed that an Execution in the House\\r\\nwould shortly take place. Ah! what could we do but what we did! We\\r\\nsighed and fainted on the sofa. Adeiu Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER 10th LAURA in continuation\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we were somewhat recovered from the overpowering Effusions of our\\r\\ngrief, Edward desired that we would consider what was the most prudent\\r\\nstep to be taken in our unhappy situation while he repaired to his\\r\\nimprisoned freind to lament over his misfortunes. We promised that we\\r\\nwould, and he set forwards on his journey to Town. During his absence\\r\\nwe faithfully complied with his Desire and after the most mature\\r\\nDeliberation, at length agreed that the best thing we could do was\\r\\nto leave the House; of which we every moment expected the officers\\r\\nof Justice to take possession. We waited therefore with the greatest\\r\\nimpatience, for the return of Edward in order to impart to him the\\r\\nresult of our Deliberations. But no Edward appeared. In vain did we\\r\\ncount the tedious moments of his absence--in vain did we weep--in\\r\\nvain even did we sigh--no Edward returned--. This was too cruel, too\\r\\nunexpected a Blow to our Gentle Sensibility--we could not support it--we\\r\\ncould only faint. At length collecting all the Resolution I was Mistress\\r\\nof, I arose and after packing up some necessary apparel for Sophia and\\r\\nmyself, I dragged her to a Carriage I had ordered and we instantly set\\r\\nout for London. As the Habitation of Augustus was within twelve miles\\r\\nof Town, it was not long e'er we arrived there, and no sooner had we\\r\\nentered Holboun than letting down one of the Front Glasses I enquired of\\r\\nevery decent-looking Person that we passed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf they had seen my Edward?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as we drove too rapidly to allow them to answer my repeated\\r\\nEnquiries, I gained little, or indeed, no information concerning him.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere am I to drive?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Postilion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo Newgate Gentle Youth\\r\\n(replied I), to see Augustus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no, no, (exclaimed Sophia) I cannot\\r\\ngo to Newgate; I shall not be able to support the sight of my Augustus\\r\\nin so cruel a confinement--my feelings are sufficiently shocked by\\r\\nthe RECITAL, of his Distress, but to behold it will overpower my\\r\\nSensibility.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As I perfectly agreed with her in the Justice of her\\r\\nSentiments the Postilion was instantly directed to return into the\\r\\nCountry. You may perhaps have been somewhat surprised my Dearest\\r\\nMarianne, that in the Distress I then endured, destitute of any support,\\r\\nand unprovided with any Habitation, I should never once have remembered\\r\\nmy Father and Mother or my paternal Cottage in the Vale of Uske. To\\r\\naccount for this seeming forgetfullness I must inform you of a trifling\\r\\ncircumstance concerning them which I have as yet never mentioned. The\\r\\ndeath of my Parents a few weeks after my Departure, is the circumstance\\r\\nI allude to. By their decease I became the lawfull Inheritress of their\\r\\nHouse and Fortune. But alas! the House had never been their own and\\r\\ntheir Fortune had only been an Annuity on their own Lives. Such is\\r\\nthe Depravity of the World! To your Mother I should have returned with\\r\\nPleasure, should have been happy to have introduced to her, my charming\\r\\nSophia and should with Chearfullness have passed the remainder of my\\r\\nLife in their dear Society in the Vale of Uske, had not one obstacle\\r\\nto the execution of so agreable a scheme, intervened; which was the\\r\\nMarriage and Removal of your Mother to a distant part of Ireland. Adeiu\\r\\nLaura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER 11th LAURA in continuation\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have a Relation in Scotland (said Sophia to me as we left London) who\\r\\nI am certain would not hesitate in receiving me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall I order the Boy\\r\\nto drive there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I--but instantly recollecting myself, exclaimed,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlas I fear it will be too long a Journey for the Horses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Unwilling\\r\\nhowever to act only from my own inadequate Knowledge of the Strength and\\r\\nAbilities of Horses, I consulted the Postilion, who was entirely of my\\r\\nOpinion concerning the Affair. We therefore determined to change Horses\\r\\nat the next Town and to travel Post the remainder of the Journey--. When\\r\\nwe arrived at the last Inn we were to stop at, which was but a few miles\\r\\nfrom the House of Sophia's Relation, unwilling to intrude our Society on\\r\\nhim unexpected and unthought of, we wrote a very elegant and well\\r\\npenned Note to him containing an account of our Destitute and melancholy\\r\\nSituation, and of our intention to spend some months with him in\\r\\nScotland. As soon as we had dispatched this Letter, we immediately\\r\\nprepared to follow it in person and were stepping into the Carriage\\r\\nfor that Purpose when our attention was attracted by the Entrance of\\r\\na coroneted Coach and 4 into the Inn-yard. A Gentleman considerably\\r\\nadvanced in years descended from it. At his first Appearance my\\r\\nSensibility was wonderfully affected and e'er I had gazed at him a 2d\\r\\ntime, an instinctive sympathy whispered to my Heart, that he was my\\r\\nGrandfather. Convinced that I could not be mistaken in my conjecture I\\r\\ninstantly sprang from the Carriage I had just entered, and following the\\r\\nVenerable Stranger into the Room he had been shewn to, I threw myself\\r\\non my knees before him and besought him to acknowledge me as his Grand\\r\\nChild. He started, and having attentively examined my features, raised\\r\\nme from the Ground and throwing his Grand-fatherly arms around my Neck,\\r\\nexclaimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAcknowledge thee! Yes dear resemblance of my Laurina and\\r\\nLaurina's Daughter, sweet image of my Claudia and my Claudia's Mother,\\r\\nI do acknowledge thee as the Daughter of the one and the Grandaughter of\\r\\nthe other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d While he was thus tenderly embracing me, Sophia astonished\\r\\nat my precipitate Departure, entered the Room in search of me. No sooner\\r\\nhad she caught the eye of the venerable Peer, than he exclaimed with\\r\\nevery mark of Astonishment--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnother Grandaughter! Yes, yes, I see you\\r\\nare the Daughter of my Laurina's eldest Girl; your resemblance to the\\r\\nbeauteous Matilda sufficiently proclaims it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Sophia, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen\\r\\nI first beheld you the instinct of Nature whispered me that we were in\\r\\nsome degree related--But whether Grandfathers, or Grandmothers, I could\\r\\nnot pretend to determine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He folded her in his arms, and whilst they\\r\\nwere tenderly embracing, the Door of the Apartment opened and a most\\r\\nbeautifull young Man appeared. On perceiving him Lord St. Clair started\\r\\nand retreating back a few paces, with uplifted Hands, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnother\\r\\nGrand-child! What an unexpected Happiness is this! to discover in the\\r\\nspace of 3 minutes, as many of my Descendants! This I am certain is\\r\\nPhilander the son of my Laurina's 3d girl the amiable Bertha; there\\r\\nwants now but the presence of Gustavus to compleat the Union of my\\r\\nLaurina's Grand-Children.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd here he is; (said a Gracefull Youth who that instant entered the\\r\\nroom) here is the Gustavus you desire to see. I am the son of Agatha\\r\\nyour Laurina's 4th and youngest Daughter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see you are indeed;\\r\\nreplied Lord St. Clair--But tell me (continued he looking fearfully\\r\\ntowards the Door) tell me, have I any other Grand-children in the\\r\\nHouse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNone my Lord.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I will provide for you all without farther\\r\\ndelay--Here are 4 Banknotes of 50L each--Take them and remember I\\r\\nhave done the Duty of a Grandfather.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He instantly left the Room and\\r\\nimmediately afterwards the House. Adeiu, Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the 12th LAURA in continuation\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may imagine how greatly we were surprised by the sudden departure\\r\\nof Lord St Clair. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIgnoble Grand-sire!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Sophia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnworthy\\r\\nGrandfather!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I, and instantly fainted in each other's arms. How\\r\\nlong we remained in this situation I know not; but when we recovered\\r\\nwe found ourselves alone, without either Gustavus, Philander, or the\\r\\nBanknotes. As we were deploring our unhappy fate, the Door of the\\r\\nApartment opened and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMacdonald\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was announced. He was Sophia's cousin.\\r\\nThe haste with which he came to our releif so soon after the receipt\\r\\nof our Note, spoke so greatly in his favour that I hesitated not to\\r\\npronounce him at first sight, a tender and simpathetic Freind. Alas!\\r\\nhe little deserved the name--for though he told us that he was much\\r\\nconcerned at our Misfortunes, yet by his own account it appeared that\\r\\nthe perusal of them, had neither drawn from him a single sigh, nor\\r\\ninduced him to bestow one curse on our vindictive stars--. He told\\r\\nSophia that his Daughter depended on her returning with him to\\r\\nMacdonald-Hall, and that as his Cousin's freind he should be happy\\r\\nto see me there also. To Macdonald-Hall, therefore we went, and were\\r\\nreceived with great kindness by Janetta the Daughter of Macdonald, and\\r\\nthe Mistress of the Mansion. Janetta was then only fifteen; naturally\\r\\nwell disposed, endowed with a susceptible Heart, and a simpathetic\\r\\nDisposition, she might, had these amiable qualities been properly\\r\\nencouraged, have been an ornament to human Nature; but unfortunately her\\r\\nFather possessed not a soul sufficiently exalted to admire so promising\\r\\na Disposition, and had endeavoured by every means on his power\\r\\nto prevent it encreasing with her Years. He had actually so far\\r\\nextinguished the natural noble Sensibility of her Heart, as to prevail\\r\\non her to accept an offer from a young Man of his Recommendation. They\\r\\nwere to be married in a few months, and Graham, was in the House when\\r\\nwe arrived. WE soon saw through his character. He was just such a Man as\\r\\none might have expected to be the choice of Macdonald. They said he was\\r\\nSensible, well-informed, and Agreable; we did not pretend to Judge of\\r\\nsuch trifles, but as we were convinced he had no soul, that he had\\r\\nnever read the sorrows of Werter, and that his Hair bore not the least\\r\\nresemblance to auburn, we were certain that Janetta could feel no\\r\\naffection for him, or at least that she ought to feel none. The very\\r\\ncircumstance of his being her father's choice too, was so much in his\\r\\ndisfavour, that had he been deserving her, in every other respect yet\\r\\nTHAT of itself ought to have been a sufficient reason in the Eyes of\\r\\nJanetta for rejecting him. These considerations we were determined to\\r\\nrepresent to her in their proper light and doubted not of meeting with\\r\\nthe desired success from one naturally so well disposed; whose errors in\\r\\nthe affair had only arisen from a want of proper confidence in her own\\r\\nopinion, and a suitable contempt of her father's. We found her indeed\\r\\nall that our warmest wishes could have hoped for; we had no difficulty\\r\\nto convince her that it was impossible she could love Graham, or that it\\r\\nwas her Duty to disobey her Father; the only thing at which she rather\\r\\nseemed to hesitate was our assertion that she must be attached to some\\r\\nother Person. For some time, she persevered in declaring that she knew\\r\\nno other young man for whom she had the the smallest Affection; but upon\\r\\nexplaining the impossibility of such a thing she said that she beleived\\r\\nshe DID LIKE Captain M'Kenrie better than any one she knew besides. This\\r\\nconfession satisfied us and after having enumerated the good Qualities\\r\\nof M'Kenrie and assured her that she was violently in love with him, we\\r\\ndesired to know whether he had ever in any wise declared his affection\\r\\nto her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo far from having ever declared it, I have no reason to imagine that\\r\\nhe has ever felt any for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Janetta. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat he certainly adores\\r\\nyou (replied Sophia) there can be no doubt--. The Attachment must be\\r\\nreciprocal. Did he never gaze on you with admiration--tenderly press\\r\\nyour hand--drop an involantary tear--and leave the room abruptly?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever (replied she) that I remember--he has always left the room indeed\\r\\nwhen his visit has been ended, but has never gone away particularly\\r\\nabruptly or without making a bow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Indeed my Love (said I) you must be\\r\\nmistaken--for it is absolutely impossible that he should ever have left\\r\\nyou but with Confusion, Despair, and Precipitation. Consider but for a\\r\\nmoment Janetta, and you must be convinced how absurd it is to suppose\\r\\nthat he could ever make a Bow, or behave like any other Person.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Having settled this Point to our satisfaction, the next we took into\\r\\nconsideration was, to determine in what manner we should inform M'Kenrie\\r\\nof the favourable Opinion Janetta entertained of him.... We at length\\r\\nagreed to acquaint him with it by an anonymous Letter which Sophia drew\\r\\nup in the following manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! happy Lover of the beautifull Janetta, oh! amiable Possessor of\\r\\nHER Heart whose hand is destined to another, why do you thus delay a\\r\\nconfession of your attachment to the amiable Object of it? Oh! consider\\r\\nthat a few weeks will at once put an end to every flattering Hope that\\r\\nyou may now entertain, by uniting the unfortunate Victim of her father's\\r\\nCruelty to the execrable and detested Graham.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlas! why do you thus so cruelly connive at the projected Misery of\\r\\nher and of yourself by delaying to communicate that scheme which had\\r\\ndoubtless long possessed your imagination? A secret Union will at once\\r\\nsecure the felicity of both.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amiable M'Kenrie, whose modesty as he afterwards assured us had\\r\\nbeen the only reason of his having so long concealed the violence of\\r\\nhis affection for Janetta, on receiving this Billet flew on the wings of\\r\\nLove to Macdonald-Hall, and so powerfully pleaded his Attachment to her\\r\\nwho inspired it, that after a few more private interveiws, Sophia and\\r\\nI experienced the satisfaction of seeing them depart for Gretna-Green,\\r\\nwhich they chose for the celebration of their Nuptials, in preference\\r\\nto any other place although it was at a considerable distance from\\r\\nMacdonald-Hall. Adeiu Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the 13th LAURA in continuation\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had been gone nearly a couple of Hours, before either Macdonald or\\r\\nGraham had entertained any suspicion of the affair. And they might not\\r\\neven then have suspected it, but for the following little Accident.\\r\\nSophia happening one day to open a private Drawer in Macdonald's Library\\r\\nwith one of her own keys, discovered that it was the Place where he\\r\\nkept his Papers of consequence and amongst them some bank notes of\\r\\nconsiderable amount. This discovery she imparted to me; and having\\r\\nagreed together that it would be a proper treatment of so vile a Wretch\\r\\nas Macdonald to deprive him of money, perhaps dishonestly gained, it was\\r\\ndetermined that the next time we should either of us happen to go that\\r\\nway, we would take one or more of the Bank notes from the drawer. This\\r\\nwell meant Plan we had often successfully put in Execution; but alas!\\r\\non the very day of Janetta's Escape, as Sophia was majestically removing\\r\\nthe 5th Bank-note from the Drawer to her own purse, she was suddenly\\r\\nmost impertinently interrupted in her employment by the entrance of\\r\\nMacdonald himself, in a most abrupt and precipitate Manner. Sophia (who\\r\\nthough naturally all winning sweetness could when occasions demanded it\\r\\ncall forth the Dignity of her sex) instantly put on a most forbidding\\r\\nlook, and darting an angry frown on the undaunted culprit, demanded in\\r\\na haughty tone of voice \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWherefore her retirement was thus insolently\\r\\nbroken in on?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The unblushing Macdonald, without even endeavouring to\\r\\nexculpate himself from the crime he was charged with, meanly endeavoured\\r\\nto reproach Sophia with ignobly defrauding him of his money... The\\r\\ndignity of Sophia was wounded; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWretch (exclaimed she, hastily replacing\\r\\nthe Bank-note in the Drawer) how darest thou to accuse me of an Act,\\r\\nof which the bare idea makes me blush?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The base wretch was still\\r\\nunconvinced and continued to upbraid the justly-offended Sophia in such\\r\\nopprobious Language, that at length he so greatly provoked the gentle\\r\\nsweetness of her Nature, as to induce her to revenge herself on him by\\r\\ninforming him of Janetta's Elopement, and of the active Part we had\\r\\nboth taken in the affair. At this period of their Quarrel I entered the\\r\\nLibrary and was as you may imagine equally offended as Sophia at the\\r\\nill-grounded accusations of the malevolent and contemptible Macdonald.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBase Miscreant! (cried I) how canst thou thus undauntedly endeavour to\\r\\nsully the spotless reputation of such bright Excellence? Why dost thou\\r\\nnot suspect MY innocence as soon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBe satisfied Madam (replied he) I\\r\\nDO suspect it, and therefore must desire that you will both leave this\\r\\nHouse in less than half an hour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shall go willingly; (answered Sophia) our hearts have long detested\\r\\nthee, and nothing but our freindship for thy Daughter could have induced\\r\\nus to remain so long beneath thy roof.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour Freindship for my Daughter has indeed been most powerfully exerted\\r\\nby throwing her into the arms of an unprincipled Fortune-hunter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n (replied he)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, (exclaimed I) amidst every misfortune, it will afford us some\\r\\nconsolation to reflect that by this one act of Freindship to Janetta,\\r\\nwe have amply discharged every obligation that we have received from her\\r\\nfather.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must indeed be a most gratefull reflection, to your exalted minds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n (said he.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as we had packed up our wardrobe and valuables, we left\\r\\nMacdonald Hall, and after having walked about a mile and a half we\\r\\nsate down by the side of a clear limpid stream to refresh our exhausted\\r\\nlimbs. The place was suited to meditation. A grove of full-grown Elms\\r\\nsheltered us from the East--. A Bed of full-grown Nettles from the\\r\\nWest--. Before us ran the murmuring brook and behind us ran the\\r\\nturn-pike road. We were in a mood for contemplation and in a Disposition\\r\\nto enjoy so beautifull a spot. A mutual silence which had for some time\\r\\nreigned between us, was at length broke by my exclaiming--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a lovely\\r\\nscene! Alas why are not Edward and Augustus here to enjoy its Beauties\\r\\nwith us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! my beloved Laura (cried Sophia) for pity's sake forbear recalling\\r\\nto my remembrance the unhappy situation of my imprisoned Husband. Alas,\\r\\nwhat would I not give to learn the fate of my Augustus! to know if he is\\r\\nstill in Newgate, or if he is yet hung. But never shall I be able so far\\r\\nto conquer my tender sensibility as to enquire after him. Oh! do not\\r\\nI beseech you ever let me again hear you repeat his beloved name--. It\\r\\naffects me too deeply--. I cannot bear to hear him mentioned it wounds\\r\\nmy feelings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcuse me my Sophia for having thus unwillingly offended you--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied\\r\\nI--and then changing the conversation, desired her to admire the noble\\r\\nGrandeur of the Elms which sheltered us from the Eastern Zephyr. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlas!\\r\\nmy Laura (returned she) avoid so melancholy a subject, I intreat you.\\r\\nDo not again wound my Sensibility by observations on those elms. They\\r\\nremind me of Augustus. He was like them, tall, magestic--he possessed\\r\\nthat noble grandeur which you admire in them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was silent, fearfull lest I might any more unwillingly distress her by\\r\\nfixing on any other subject of conversation which might again remind her\\r\\nof Augustus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy do you not speak my Laura? (said she after a short pause) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot\\r\\nsupport this silence you must not leave me to my own reflections; they\\r\\never recur to Augustus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a beautifull sky! (said I) How charmingly is the azure varied by\\r\\nthose delicate streaks of white!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my Laura (replied she hastily withdrawing her Eyes from a momentary\\r\\nglance at the sky) do not thus distress me by calling my Attention to\\r\\nan object which so cruelly reminds me of my Augustus's blue sattin\\r\\nwaistcoat striped in white! In pity to your unhappy freind avoid a\\r\\nsubject so distressing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d What could I do? The feelings of Sophia were\\r\\nat that time so exquisite, and the tenderness she felt for Augustus so\\r\\npoignant that I had not power to start any other topic, justly fearing\\r\\nthat it might in some unforseen manner again awaken all her sensibility\\r\\nby directing her thoughts to her Husband. Yet to be silent would be\\r\\ncruel; she had intreated me to talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this Dilemma I was most fortunately releived by an accident truly\\r\\napropos; it was the lucky overturning of a Gentleman's Phaeton, on the\\r\\nroad which ran murmuring behind us. It was a most fortunate accident\\r\\nas it diverted the attention of Sophia from the melancholy reflections\\r\\nwhich she had been before indulging. We instantly quitted our seats and\\r\\nran to the rescue of those who but a few moments before had been in so\\r\\nelevated a situation as a fashionably high Phaeton, but who were\\r\\nnow laid low and sprawling in the Dust. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat an ample subject for\\r\\nreflection on the uncertain Enjoyments of this World, would not that\\r\\nPhaeton and the Life of Cardinal Wolsey afford a thinking Mind!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I\\r\\nto Sophia as we were hastening to the field of Action.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not time to answer me, for every thought was now engaged by the\\r\\nhorrid spectacle before us. Two Gentlemen most elegantly attired\\r\\nbut weltering in their blood was what first struck our Eyes--we\\r\\napproached--they were Edward and Augustus--. Yes dearest Marianne they\\r\\nwere our Husbands. Sophia shreiked and fainted on the ground--I screamed\\r\\nand instantly ran mad--. We remained thus mutually deprived of our\\r\\nsenses, some minutes, and on regaining them were deprived of them\\r\\nagain. For an Hour and a Quarter did we continue in this unfortunate\\r\\nsituation--Sophia fainting every moment and I running mad as often. At\\r\\nlength a groan from the hapless Edward (who alone retained any share\\r\\nof life) restored us to ourselves. Had we indeed before imagined that\\r\\neither of them lived, we should have been more sparing of our Greif--but\\r\\nas we had supposed when we first beheld them that they were no more,\\r\\nwe knew that nothing could remain to be done but what we were about.\\r\\nNo sooner did we therefore hear my Edward's groan than postponing our\\r\\nlamentations for the present, we hastily ran to the Dear Youth and\\r\\nkneeling on each side of him implored him not to die--. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLaura (said He\\r\\nfixing his now languid Eyes on me) I fear I have been overturned.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was overjoyed to find him yet sensible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! tell me Edward (said I) tell me I beseech you before you die, what\\r\\nhas befallen you since that unhappy Day in which Augustus was arrested\\r\\nand we were separated--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (said he) and instantly fetching a deep sigh, Expired--. Sophia\\r\\nimmediately sank again into a swoon--. MY greif was more audible. My\\r\\nVoice faltered, My Eyes assumed a vacant stare, my face became as pale\\r\\nas Death, and my senses were considerably impaired--.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTalk not to me of Phaetons (said I, raving in a frantic, incoherent\\r\\nmanner)--Give me a violin--. I'll play to him and sooth him in his\\r\\nmelancholy Hours--Beware ye gentle Nymphs of Cupid's Thunderbolts, avoid\\r\\nthe piercing shafts of Jupiter--Look at that grove of Firs--I see a Leg\\r\\nof Mutton--They told me Edward was not Dead; but they deceived me--they\\r\\ntook him for a cucumber--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thus I continued wildly exclaiming on my\\r\\nEdward's Death--. For two Hours did I rave thus madly and should not\\r\\nthen have left off, as I was not in the least fatigued, had not Sophia\\r\\nwho was just recovered from her swoon, intreated me to consider that\\r\\nNight was now approaching and that the Damps began to fall. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd\\r\\nwhither shall we go (said I) to shelter us from either?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo that white\\r\\nCottage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (replied she pointing to a neat Building which rose up amidst\\r\\nthe grove of Elms and which I had not before observed--) I agreed and we\\r\\ninstantly walked to it--we knocked at the door--it was opened by an old\\r\\nwoman; on being requested to afford us a Night's Lodging, she informed\\r\\nus that her House was but small, that she had only two Bedrooms, but\\r\\nthat However we should be wellcome to one of them. We were satisfied and\\r\\nfollowed the good woman into the House where we were greatly cheered\\r\\nby the sight of a comfortable fire--. She was a widow and had only one\\r\\nDaughter, who was then just seventeen--One of the best of ages; but\\r\\nalas! she was very plain and her name was Bridget..... Nothing therfore\\r\\ncould be expected from her--she could not be supposed to possess either\\r\\nexalted Ideas, Delicate Feelings or refined Sensibilities--. She was\\r\\nnothing more than a mere good-tempered, civil and obliging young woman;\\r\\nas such we could scarcely dislike here--she was only an Object of\\r\\nContempt--. Adeiu Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the 14th LAURA in continuation\\r\\n\\r\\nArm yourself my amiable young Freind with all the philosophy you are\\r\\nMistress of; summon up all the fortitude you possess, for alas! in the\\r\\nperusal of the following Pages your sensibility will be most severely\\r\\ntried. Ah! what were the misfortunes I had before experienced and which\\r\\nI have already related to you, to the one I am now going to inform you\\r\\nof. The Death of my Father and my Mother and my Husband though almost\\r\\nmore than my gentle Nature could support, were trifles in comparison\\r\\nto the misfortune I am now proceeding to relate. The morning after\\r\\nour arrival at the Cottage, Sophia complained of a violent pain in her\\r\\ndelicate limbs, accompanied with a disagreable Head-ake She attributed\\r\\nit to a cold caught by her continued faintings in the open air as the\\r\\nDew was falling the Evening before. This I feared was but too probably\\r\\nthe case; since how could it be otherwise accounted for that I should\\r\\nhave escaped the same indisposition, but by supposing that the\\r\\nbodily Exertions I had undergone in my repeated fits of frenzy had so\\r\\neffectually circulated and warmed my Blood as to make me proof against\\r\\nthe chilling Damps of Night, whereas, Sophia lying totally inactive\\r\\non the ground must have been exposed to all their severity. I was most\\r\\nseriously alarmed by her illness which trifling as it may appear to\\r\\nyou, a certain instinctive sensibility whispered me, would in the End be\\r\\nfatal to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! my fears were but too fully justified; she grew gradually\\r\\nworse--and I daily became more alarmed for her. At length she was\\r\\nobliged to confine herself solely to the Bed allotted us by our worthy\\r\\nLandlady--. Her disorder turned to a galloping Consumption and in a few\\r\\ndays carried her off. Amidst all my Lamentations for her (and violent\\r\\nyou may suppose they were) I yet received some consolation in the\\r\\nreflection of my having paid every attention to her, that could be\\r\\noffered, in her illness. I had wept over her every Day--had bathed her\\r\\nsweet face with my tears and had pressed her fair Hands continually in\\r\\nmine--. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy beloved Laura (said she to me a few Hours before she died)\\r\\ntake warning from my unhappy End and avoid the imprudent conduct which\\r\\nhad occasioned it... Beware of fainting-fits... Though at the time they\\r\\nmay be refreshing and agreable yet beleive me they will in the end, if\\r\\ntoo often repeated and at improper seasons, prove destructive to your\\r\\nConstitution... My fate will teach you this.. I die a Martyr to my greif\\r\\nfor the loss of Augustus.. One fatal swoon has cost me my Life.. Beware\\r\\nof swoons Dear Laura.... A frenzy fit is not one quarter so pernicious;\\r\\nit is an exercise to the Body and if not too violent, is I dare say\\r\\nconducive to Health in its consequences--Run mad as often as you chuse;\\r\\nbut do not faint--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were the last words she ever addressed to me.. It was her dieing\\r\\nAdvice to her afflicted Laura, who has ever most faithfully adhered to\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having attended my lamented freind to her Early Grave, I\\r\\nimmediately (tho' late at night) left the detested Village in which\\r\\nshe died, and near which had expired my Husband and Augustus. I had not\\r\\nwalked many yards from it before I was overtaken by a stage-coach,\\r\\nin which I instantly took a place, determined to proceed in it to\\r\\nEdinburgh, where I hoped to find some kind some pitying Freind who would\\r\\nreceive and comfort me in my afflictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was so dark when I entered the Coach that I could not distinguish\\r\\nthe Number of my Fellow-travellers; I could only perceive that they were\\r\\nmany. Regardless however of anything concerning them, I gave myself up\\r\\nto my own sad Reflections. A general silence prevailed--A silence, which\\r\\nwas by nothing interrupted but by the loud and repeated snores of one of\\r\\nthe Party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat an illiterate villain must that man be! (thought I to myself) What\\r\\na total want of delicate refinement must he have, who can thus shock our\\r\\nsenses by such a brutal noise! He must I am certain be capable of every\\r\\nbad action! There is no crime too black for such a Character!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thus\\r\\nreasoned I within myself, and doubtless such were the reflections of my\\r\\nfellow travellers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, returning Day enabled me to behold the unprincipled Scoundrel\\r\\nwho had so violently disturbed my feelings. It was Sir Edward the father\\r\\nof my Deceased Husband. By his side sate Augusta, and on the same seat\\r\\nwith me were your Mother and Lady Dorothea. Imagine my surprise at\\r\\nfinding myself thus seated amongst my old Acquaintance. Great as was my\\r\\nastonishment, it was yet increased, when on looking out of Windows,\\r\\nI beheld the Husband of Philippa, with Philippa by his side, on the\\r\\nCoachbox and when on looking behind I beheld, Philander and Gustavus in\\r\\nthe Basket. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Heavens, (exclaimed I) is it possible that I should\\r\\nso unexpectedly be surrounded by my nearest Relations and Connections?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n These words roused the rest of the Party, and every eye was directed to\\r\\nthe corner in which I sat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my Isabel (continued I throwing myself\\r\\nacross Lady Dorothea into her arms) receive once more to your Bosom the\\r\\nunfortunate Laura. Alas! when we last parted in the Vale of Usk, I was\\r\\nhappy in being united to the best of Edwards; I had then a Father and\\r\\na Mother, and had never known misfortunes--But now deprived of every\\r\\nfreind but you--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat! (interrupted Augusta) is my Brother dead then? Tell us I intreat\\r\\nyou what is become of him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, cold and insensible Nymph, (replied I)\\r\\nthat luckless swain your Brother, is no more, and you may now glory in\\r\\nbeing the Heiress of Sir Edward's fortune.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I had always despised her from the Day I had overheard her\\r\\nconversation with my Edward, yet in civility I complied with hers and\\r\\nSir Edward's intreaties that I would inform them of the whole melancholy\\r\\naffair. They were greatly shocked--even the obdurate Heart of Sir Edward\\r\\nand the insensible one of Augusta, were touched with sorrow, by the\\r\\nunhappy tale. At the request of your Mother I related to them every\\r\\nother misfortune which had befallen me since we parted. Of the\\r\\nimprisonment of Augustus and the absence of Edward--of our arrival\\r\\nin Scotland--of our unexpected Meeting with our Grand-father and our\\r\\ncousins--of our visit to Macdonald-Hall--of the singular service we\\r\\nthere performed towards Janetta--of her Fathers ingratitude for it.. of\\r\\nhis inhuman Behaviour, unaccountable suspicions, and barbarous treatment\\r\\nof us, in obliging us to leave the House.. of our lamentations on the\\r\\nloss of Edward and Augustus and finally of the melancholy Death of my\\r\\nbeloved Companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPity and surprise were strongly depictured in your Mother's countenance,\\r\\nduring the whole of my narration, but I am sorry to say, that to the\\r\\neternal reproach of her sensibility, the latter infinitely predominated.\\r\\nNay, faultless as my conduct had certainly been during the whole course\\r\\nof my late misfortunes and adventures, she pretended to find fault with\\r\\nmy behaviour in many of the situations in which I had been placed. As\\r\\nI was sensible myself, that I had always behaved in a manner which\\r\\nreflected Honour on my Feelings and Refinement, I paid little attention\\r\\nto what she said, and desired her to satisfy my Curiosity by informing\\r\\nme how she came there, instead of wounding my spotless reputation with\\r\\nunjustifiable Reproaches. As soon as she had complyed with my wishes in\\r\\nthis particular and had given me an accurate detail of every thing that\\r\\nhad befallen her since our separation (the particulars of which if you\\r\\nare not already acquainted with, your Mother will give you) I applied to\\r\\nAugusta for the same information respecting herself, Sir Edward and Lady\\r\\nDorothea.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe told me that having a considerable taste for the Beauties of Nature,\\r\\nher curiosity to behold the delightful scenes it exhibited in that part\\r\\nof the World had been so much raised by Gilpin's Tour to the Highlands,\\r\\nthat she had prevailed on her Father to undertake a Tour to Scotland and\\r\\nhad persuaded Lady Dorothea to accompany them. That they had arrived at\\r\\nEdinburgh a few Days before and from thence had made daily Excursions\\r\\ninto the Country around in the Stage Coach they were then in, from one\\r\\nof which Excursions they were at that time returning. My next enquiries\\r\\nwere concerning Philippa and her Husband, the latter of whom I learned\\r\\nhaving spent all her fortune, had recourse for subsistence to the talent\\r\\nin which, he had always most excelled, namely, Driving, and that\\r\\nhaving sold every thing which belonged to them except their Coach, had\\r\\nconverted it into a Stage and in order to be removed from any of his\\r\\nformer Acquaintance, had driven it to Edinburgh from whence he went to\\r\\nSterling every other Day. That Philippa still retaining her affection\\r\\nfor her ungratefull Husband, had followed him to Scotland and generally\\r\\naccompanied him in his little Excursions to Sterling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has only been\\r\\nto throw a little money into their Pockets (continued Augusta) that my\\r\\nFather has always travelled in their Coach to veiw the beauties of the\\r\\nCountry since our arrival in Scotland--for it would certainly have been\\r\\nmuch more agreable to us, to visit the Highlands in a Postchaise\\r\\nthan merely to travel from Edinburgh to Sterling and from Sterling\\r\\nto Edinburgh every other Day in a crowded and uncomfortable Stage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nperfectly agreed with her in her sentiments on the affair, and secretly\\r\\nblamed Sir Edward for thus sacrificing his Daughter's Pleasure for the\\r\\nsake of a ridiculous old woman whose folly in marrying so young a man\\r\\nought to be punished. His Behaviour however was entirely of a peice\\r\\nwith his general Character; for what could be expected from a man who\\r\\npossessed not the smallest atom of Sensibility, who scarcely knew the\\r\\nmeaning of simpathy, and who actually snored--. Adeiu Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the 15th LAURA in continuation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived at the town where we were to Breakfast, I was determined\\r\\nto speak with Philander and Gustavus, and to that purpose as soon as\\r\\nI left the Carriage, I went to the Basket and tenderly enquired after\\r\\ntheir Health, expressing my fears of the uneasiness of their situation.\\r\\nAt first they seemed rather confused at my appearance dreading no doubt\\r\\nthat I might call them to account for the money which our Grandfather\\r\\nhad left me and which they had unjustly deprived me of, but finding\\r\\nthat I mentioned nothing of the Matter, they desired me to step into\\r\\nthe Basket as we might there converse with greater ease. Accordingly I\\r\\nentered and whilst the rest of the party were devouring green tea and\\r\\nbuttered toast, we feasted ourselves in a more refined and sentimental\\r\\nManner by a confidential Conversation. I informed them of every thing\\r\\nwhich had befallen me during the course of my life, and at my request\\r\\nthey related to me every incident of theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are the sons as you already know, of the two youngest Daughters\\r\\nwhich Lord St Clair had by Laurina an italian opera girl. Our mothers\\r\\ncould neither of them exactly ascertain who were our Father, though it\\r\\nis generally beleived that Philander, is the son of one Philip Jones\\r\\na Bricklayer and that my Father was one Gregory Staves a Staymaker of\\r\\nEdinburgh. This is however of little consequence for as our Mothers were\\r\\ncertainly never married to either of them it reflects no Dishonour on\\r\\nour Blood, which is of a most ancient and unpolluted kind. Bertha (the\\r\\nMother of Philander) and Agatha (my own Mother) always lived together.\\r\\nThey were neither of them very rich; their united fortunes had\\r\\noriginally amounted to nine thousand Pounds, but as they had always\\r\\nlived on the principal of it, when we were fifteen it was diminished to\\r\\nnine Hundred. This nine Hundred they always kept in a Drawer in one\\r\\nof the Tables which stood in our common sitting Parlour, for the\\r\\nconvenience of having it always at Hand. Whether it was from this\\r\\ncircumstance, of its being easily taken, or from a wish of being\\r\\nindependant, or from an excess of sensibility (for which we were always\\r\\nremarkable) I cannot now determine, but certain it is that when we had\\r\\nreached our 15th year, we took the nine Hundred Pounds and ran away.\\r\\nHaving obtained this prize we were determined to manage it with eoconomy\\r\\nand not to spend it either with folly or Extravagance. To this purpose\\r\\nwe therefore divided it into nine parcels, one of which we devoted to\\r\\nVictuals, the 2d to Drink, the 3d to Housekeeping, the 4th to Carriages,\\r\\nthe 5th to Horses, the 6th to Servants, the 7th to Amusements, the 8th\\r\\nto Cloathes and the 9th to Silver Buckles. Having thus arranged our\\r\\nExpences for two months (for we expected to make the nine Hundred Pounds\\r\\nlast as long) we hastened to London and had the good luck to spend it in\\r\\n7 weeks and a Day which was 6 Days sooner than we had intended. As soon\\r\\nas we had thus happily disencumbered ourselves from the weight of\\r\\nso much money, we began to think of returning to our Mothers, but\\r\\naccidentally hearing that they were both starved to Death, we gave over\\r\\nthe design and determined to engage ourselves to some strolling Company\\r\\nof Players, as we had always a turn for the Stage. Accordingly we\\r\\noffered our services to one and were accepted; our Company was\\r\\nindeed rather small, as it consisted only of the Manager his wife\\r\\nand ourselves, but there were fewer to pay and the only inconvenience\\r\\nattending it was the Scarcity of Plays which for want of People to fill\\r\\nthe Characters, we could perform. We did not mind trifles however--.\\r\\nOne of our most admired Performances was MACBETH, in which we were\\r\\ntruly great. The Manager always played BANQUO himself, his Wife my LADY\\r\\nMACBETH. I did the THREE WITCHES and Philander acted ALL THE REST. To\\r\\nsay the truth this tragedy was not only the Best, but the only Play\\r\\nthat we ever performed; and after having acted it all over England, and\\r\\nWales, we came to Scotland to exhibit it over the remainder of Great\\r\\nBritain. We happened to be quartered in that very Town, where you came\\r\\nand met your Grandfather--. We were in the Inn-yard when his Carriage\\r\\nentered and perceiving by the arms to whom it belonged, and knowing\\r\\nthat Lord St Clair was our Grandfather, we agreed to endeavour to get\\r\\nsomething from him by discovering the Relationship--. You know how well\\r\\nit succeeded--. Having obtained the two Hundred Pounds, we instantly\\r\\nleft the Town, leaving our Manager and his Wife to act MACBETH by\\r\\nthemselves, and took the road to Sterling, where we spent our little\\r\\nfortune with great ECLAT. We are now returning to Edinburgh in order to\\r\\nget some preferment in the Acting way; and such my Dear Cousin is our\\r\\nHistory.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thanked the amiable Youth for his entertaining narration, and after\\r\\nexpressing my wishes for their Welfare and Happiness, left them in\\r\\ntheir little Habitation and returned to my other Freinds who impatiently\\r\\nexpected me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy adventures are now drawing to a close my dearest Marianne; at least\\r\\nfor the present.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived at Edinburgh Sir Edward told me that as the Widow of his\\r\\nson, he desired I would accept from his Hands of four Hundred a year. I\\r\\ngraciously promised that I would, but could not help observing that the\\r\\nunsimpathetic Baronet offered it more on account of my being the Widow\\r\\nof Edward than in being the refined and amiable Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took up my Residence in a Romantic Village in the Highlands\\r\\nof Scotland where I have ever since continued, and where I can\\r\\nuninterrupted by unmeaning Visits, indulge in a melancholy solitude, my\\r\\nunceasing Lamentations for the Death of my Father, my Mother, my Husband\\r\\nand my Freind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugusta has been for several years united to Graham the Man of all\\r\\nothers most suited to her; she became acquainted with him during her\\r\\nstay in Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Edward in hopes of gaining an Heir to his Title and Estate, at the\\r\\nsame time married Lady Dorothea--. His wishes have been answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilander and Gustavus, after having raised their reputation by their\\r\\nPerformances in the Theatrical Line at Edinburgh, removed to Covent\\r\\nGarden, where they still exhibit under the assumed names of LUVIS and\\r\\nQUICK.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilippa has long paid the Debt of Nature, Her Husband however still\\r\\ncontinues to drive the Stage-Coach from Edinburgh to Sterling:--Adeiu my\\r\\nDearest Marianne.

Lesley Castle Janry 3rd--1792.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Brother has just left us. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMatilda (said he at parting) you and\\r\\nMargaret will I am certain take all the care of my dear little one, that\\r\\nshe might have received from an indulgent, and affectionate and amiable\\r\\nMother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tears rolled down his cheeks as he spoke these words--the\\r\\nremembrance of her, who had so wantonly disgraced the Maternal character\\r\\nand so openly violated the conjugal Duties, prevented his adding\\r\\nanything farther; he embraced his sweet Child and after saluting Matilda\\r\\nand Me hastily broke from us and seating himself in his Chaise, pursued\\r\\nthe road to Aberdeen. Never was there a better young Man! Ah! how little\\r\\ndid he deserve the misfortunes he has experienced in the Marriage state.\\r\\nSo good a Husband to so bad a Wife! for you know my dear Charlotte that\\r\\nthe Worthless Louisa left him, her Child and reputation a few weeks ago\\r\\nin company with Danvers and dishonour. Never was there a sweeter face, a\\r\\nfiner form, or a less amiable Heart than Louisa owned! Her child already\\r\\npossesses the personal Charms of her unhappy Mother! May she inherit\\r\\nfrom her Father all his mental ones! Lesley is at present but five and\\r\\ntwenty, and has already given himself up to melancholy and Despair;\\r\\nwhat a difference between him and his Father! Sir George is 57 and still\\r\\nremains the Beau, the flighty stripling, the gay Lad, and sprightly\\r\\nYoungster, that his Son was really about five years back, and that HE\\r\\nhas affected to appear ever since my remembrance. While our father is\\r\\nfluttering about the streets of London, gay, dissipated, and Thoughtless\\r\\nat the age of 57, Matilda and I continue secluded from Mankind in our\\r\\nold and Mouldering Castle, which is situated two miles from Perth on a\\r\\nbold projecting Rock, and commands an extensive veiw of the Town and its\\r\\ndelightful Environs. But tho' retired from almost all the World, (for\\r\\nwe visit no one but the M'Leods, The M'Kenzies, the M'Phersons, the\\r\\nM'Cartneys, the M'Donalds, The M'kinnons, the M'lellans, the M'kays,\\r\\nthe Macbeths and the Macduffs) we are neither dull nor unhappy; on the\\r\\ncontrary there never were two more lively, more agreable or more witty\\r\\ngirls, than we are; not an hour in the Day hangs heavy on our Hands. We\\r\\nread, we work, we walk, and when fatigued with these Employments releive\\r\\nour spirits, either by a lively song, a graceful Dance, or by some smart\\r\\nbon-mot, and witty repartee. We are handsome my dear Charlotte, very\\r\\nhandsome and the greatest of our Perfections is, that we are entirely\\r\\ninsensible of them ourselves. But why do I thus dwell on myself! Let me\\r\\nrather repeat the praise of our dear little Neice the innocent Louisa,\\r\\nwho is at present sweetly smiling in a gentle Nap, as she reposes on the\\r\\nsofa. The dear Creature is just turned of two years old; as handsome as\\r\\ntho' 2 and 20, as sensible as tho' 2 and 30, and as prudent as tho' 2\\r\\nand 40. To convince you of this, I must inform you that she has a very\\r\\nfine complexion and very pretty features, that she already knows the two\\r\\nfirst letters in the Alphabet, and that she never tears her frocks--. If\\r\\nI have not now convinced you of her Beauty, Sense and Prudence, I have\\r\\nnothing more to urge in support of my assertion, and you will therefore\\r\\nhave no way of deciding the Affair but by coming to Lesley-Castle, and\\r\\nby a personal acquaintance with Louisa, determine for yourself. Ah! my\\r\\ndear Freind, how happy should I be to see you within these venerable\\r\\nWalls! It is now four years since my removal from School has separated\\r\\nme from you; that two such tender Hearts, so closely linked together by\\r\\nthe ties of simpathy and Freindship, should be so widely removed from\\r\\neach other, is vastly moving. I live in Perthshire, You in Sussex. We\\r\\nmight meet in London, were my Father disposed to carry me there, and\\r\\nwere your Mother to be there at the same time. We might meet at Bath,\\r\\nat Tunbridge, or anywhere else indeed, could we but be at the same place\\r\\ntogether. We have only to hope that such a period may arrive. My Father\\r\\ndoes not return to us till Autumn; my Brother will leave Scotland in a\\r\\nfew Days; he is impatient to travel. Mistaken Youth! He vainly flatters\\r\\nhimself that change of Air will heal the Wounds of a broken Heart! You\\r\\nwill join with me I am certain my dear Charlotte, in prayers for the\\r\\nrecovery of the unhappy Lesley's peace of Mind, which must ever be\\r\\nessential to that of your sincere freind M. Lesley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the SECOND From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY in answer.\\r\\nGlenford Febry 12\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a thousand excuses to beg for having so long delayed thanking you\\r\\nmy dear Peggy for your agreable Letter, which beleive me I should not\\r\\nhave deferred doing, had not every moment of my time during the last\\r\\nfive weeks been so fully employed in the necessary arrangements for\\r\\nmy sisters wedding, as to allow me no time to devote either to you or\\r\\nmyself. And now what provokes me more than anything else is that the\\r\\nMatch is broke off, and all my Labour thrown away. Imagine how great\\r\\nthe Dissapointment must be to me, when you consider that after having\\r\\nlaboured both by Night and by Day, in order to get the Wedding dinner\\r\\nready by the time appointed, after having roasted Beef, Broiled Mutton,\\r\\nand Stewed Soup enough to last the new-married Couple through the\\r\\nHoney-moon, I had the mortification of finding that I had been Roasting,\\r\\nBroiling and Stewing both the Meat and Myself to no purpose. Indeed my\\r\\ndear Freind, I never remember suffering any vexation equal to what I\\r\\nexperienced on last Monday when my sister came running to me in the\\r\\nstore-room with her face as White as a Whipt syllabub, and told me that\\r\\nHervey had been thrown from his Horse, had fractured his Scull and was\\r\\npronounced by his surgeon to be in the most emminent Danger. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood God!\\r\\n(said I) you dont say so? Why what in the name of Heaven will become\\r\\nof all the Victuals! We shall never be able to eat it while it is good.\\r\\nHowever, we'll call in the Surgeon to help us. I shall be able to manage\\r\\nthe Sir-loin myself, my Mother will eat the soup, and You and the Doctor\\r\\nmust finish the rest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Here I was interrupted, by seeing my poor Sister\\r\\nfall down to appearance Lifeless upon one of the Chests, where we keep\\r\\nour Table linen. I immediately called my Mother and the Maids, and at\\r\\nlast we brought her to herself again; as soon as ever she was sensible,\\r\\nshe expressed a determination of going instantly to Henry, and was so\\r\\nwildly bent on this Scheme, that we had the greatest Difficulty in the\\r\\nWorld to prevent her putting it in execution; at last however more by\\r\\nForce than Entreaty we prevailed on her to go into her room; we laid\\r\\nher upon the Bed, and she continued for some Hours in the most dreadful\\r\\nConvulsions. My Mother and I continued in the room with her, and when\\r\\nany intervals of tolerable Composure in Eloisa would allow us, we joined\\r\\nin heartfelt lamentations on the dreadful Waste in our provisions which\\r\\nthis Event must occasion, and in concerting some plan for getting rid of\\r\\nthem. We agreed that the best thing we could do was to begin eating them\\r\\nimmediately, and accordingly we ordered up the cold Ham and Fowls, and\\r\\ninstantly began our Devouring Plan on them with great Alacrity. We would\\r\\nhave persuaded Eloisa to have taken a Wing of a Chicken, but she would\\r\\nnot be persuaded. She was however much quieter than she had been;\\r\\nthe convulsions she had before suffered having given way to an almost\\r\\nperfect Insensibility. We endeavoured to rouse her by every means in our\\r\\npower, but to no purpose. I talked to her of Henry. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Eloisa (said\\r\\nI) there's no occasion for your crying so much about such a trifle. (for\\r\\nI was willing to make light of it in order to comfort her) I beg you\\r\\nwould not mind it--You see it does not vex me in the least; though\\r\\nperhaps I may suffer most from it after all; for I shall not only be\\r\\nobliged to eat up all the Victuals I have dressed already, but must if\\r\\nHenry should recover (which however is not very likely) dress as much\\r\\nfor you again; or should he die (as I suppose he will) I shall still\\r\\nhave to prepare a Dinner for you whenever you marry any one else. So\\r\\nyou see that tho' perhaps for the present it may afflict you to think\\r\\nof Henry's sufferings, Yet I dare say he'll die soon, and then his pain\\r\\nwill be over and you will be easy, whereas my Trouble will last much\\r\\nlonger for work as hard as I may, I am certain that the pantry cannot be\\r\\ncleared in less than a fortnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thus I did all in my power to console\\r\\nher, but without any effect, and at last as I saw that she did not seem\\r\\nto listen to me, I said no more, but leaving her with my Mother I took\\r\\ndown the remains of The Ham and Chicken, and sent William to ask how\\r\\nHenry did. He was not expected to live many Hours; he died the same day.\\r\\nWe took all possible care to break the melancholy Event to Eloisa in the\\r\\ntenderest manner; yet in spite of every precaution, her sufferings on\\r\\nhearing it were too violent for her reason, and she continued for many\\r\\nhours in a high Delirium. She is still extremely ill, and her Physicians\\r\\nare greatly afraid of her going into a Decline. We are therefore\\r\\npreparing for Bristol, where we mean to be in the course of the next\\r\\nweek. And now my dear Margaret let me talk a little of your affairs; and\\r\\nin the first place I must inform you that it is confidently reported,\\r\\nyour Father is going to be married; I am very unwilling to beleive so\\r\\nunpleasing a report, and at the same time cannot wholly discredit it. I\\r\\nhave written to my freind Susan Fitzgerald, for information concerning\\r\\nit, which as she is at present in Town, she will be very able to give\\r\\nme. I know not who is the Lady. I think your Brother is extremely\\r\\nright in the resolution he has taken of travelling, as it will perhaps\\r\\ncontribute to obliterate from his remembrance, those disagreable Events,\\r\\nwhich have lately so much afflicted him--I am happy to find that\\r\\ntho' secluded from all the World, neither you nor Matilda are dull or\\r\\nunhappy--that you may never know what it is to, be either is the wish of\\r\\nyour sincerely affectionate C.L.\\r\\n\\r\\nP. S. I have this instant received an answer from my freind Susan, which\\r\\nI enclose to you, and on which you will make your own reflections.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enclosed LETTER\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dear CHARLOTTE You could not have applied for information concerning\\r\\nthe report of Sir George Lesleys Marriage, to any one better able to\\r\\ngive it you than I am. Sir George is certainly married; I was myself\\r\\npresent at the Ceremony, which you will not be surprised at when I\\r\\nsubscribe myself your Affectionate Susan Lesley\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the THIRD From Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss C. LUTTERELL Lesley\\r\\nCastle February the 16th\\r\\n\\r\\nI have made my own reflections on the letter you enclosed to me, my\\r\\nDear Charlotte and I will now tell you what those reflections were.\\r\\nI reflected that if by this second Marriage Sir George should have a\\r\\nsecond family, our fortunes must be considerably diminushed--that if\\r\\nhis Wife should be of an extravagant turn, she would encourage him\\r\\nto persevere in that gay and Dissipated way of Life to which little\\r\\nencouragement would be necessary, and which has I fear already proved\\r\\nbut too detrimental to his health and fortune--that she would now become\\r\\nMistress of those Jewels which once adorned our Mother, and which Sir\\r\\nGeorge had always promised us--that if they did not come into\\r\\nPerthshire I should not be able to gratify my curiosity of beholding my\\r\\nMother-in-law and that if they did, Matilda would no longer sit at\\r\\nthe head of her Father's table--. These my dear Charlotte were the\\r\\nmelancholy reflections which crowded into my imagination after perusing\\r\\nSusan's letter to you, and which instantly occurred to Matilda when she\\r\\nhad perused it likewise. The same ideas, the same fears, immediately\\r\\noccupied her Mind, and I know not which reflection distressed her most,\\r\\nwhether the probable Diminution of our Fortunes, or her own Consequence.\\r\\nWe both wish very much to know whether Lady Lesley is handsome and what\\r\\nis your opinion of her; as you honour her with the appellation of your\\r\\nfreind, we flatter ourselves that she must be amiable. My Brother is\\r\\nalready in Paris. He intends to quit it in a few Days, and to begin his\\r\\nroute to Italy. He writes in a most chearfull manner, says that the air\\r\\nof France has greatly recovered both his Health and Spirits; that he has\\r\\nnow entirely ceased to think of Louisa with any degree either of Pity or\\r\\nAffection, that he even feels himself obliged to her for her Elopement,\\r\\nas he thinks it very good fun to be single again. By this, you may\\r\\nperceive that he has entirely regained that chearful Gaiety, and\\r\\nsprightly Wit, for which he was once so remarkable. When he first became\\r\\nacquainted with Louisa which was little more than three years ago, he\\r\\nwas one of the most lively, the most agreable young Men of the age--.\\r\\nI beleive you never yet heard the particulars of his first acquaintance\\r\\nwith her. It commenced at our cousin Colonel Drummond's; at whose house\\r\\nin Cumberland he spent the Christmas, in which he attained the age of\\r\\ntwo and twenty. Louisa Burton was the Daughter of a distant Relation of\\r\\nMrs. Drummond, who dieing a few Months before in extreme poverty, left\\r\\nhis only Child then about eighteen to the protection of any of his\\r\\nRelations who would protect her. Mrs. Drummond was the only one who\\r\\nfound herself so disposed--Louisa was therefore removed from a miserable\\r\\nCottage in Yorkshire to an elegant Mansion in Cumberland, and from\\r\\nevery pecuniary Distress that Poverty could inflict, to every elegant\\r\\nEnjoyment that Money could purchase--. Louisa was naturally ill-tempered\\r\\nand Cunning; but she had been taught to disguise her real Disposition,\\r\\nunder the appearance of insinuating Sweetness, by a father who but too\\r\\nwell knew, that to be married, would be the only chance she would\\r\\nhave of not being starved, and who flattered himself that with such\\r\\nan extroidinary share of personal beauty, joined to a gentleness of\\r\\nManners, and an engaging address, she might stand a good chance of\\r\\npleasing some young Man who might afford to marry a girl without a\\r\\nShilling. Louisa perfectly entered into her father's schemes and was\\r\\ndetermined to forward them with all her care and attention. By dint of\\r\\nPerseverance and Application, she had at length so thoroughly disguised\\r\\nher natural disposition under the mask of Innocence, and Softness, as to\\r\\nimpose upon every one who had not by a long and constant intimacy with\\r\\nher discovered her real Character. Such was Louisa when the hapless\\r\\nLesley first beheld her at Drummond-house. His heart which (to use\\r\\nyour favourite comparison) was as delicate as sweet and as tender as a\\r\\nWhipt-syllabub, could not resist her attractions. In a very few Days,\\r\\nhe was falling in love, shortly after actually fell, and before he had\\r\\nknown her a Month, he had married her. My Father was at first highly\\r\\ndispleased at so hasty and imprudent a connection; but when he found\\r\\nthat they did not mind it, he soon became perfectly reconciled to the\\r\\nmatch. The Estate near Aberdeen which my brother possesses by the bounty\\r\\nof his great Uncle independant of Sir George, was entirely sufficient\\r\\nto support him and my Sister in Elegance and Ease. For the first\\r\\ntwelvemonth, no one could be happier than Lesley, and no one more\\r\\namiable to appearance than Louisa, and so plausibly did she act and\\r\\nso cautiously behave that tho' Matilda and I often spent several weeks\\r\\ntogether with them, yet we neither of us had any suspicion of her real\\r\\nDisposition. After the birth of Louisa however, which one would have\\r\\nthought would have strengthened her regard for Lesley, the mask she had\\r\\nso long supported was by degrees thrown aside, and as probably she then\\r\\nthought herself secure in the affection of her Husband (which did indeed\\r\\nappear if possible augmented by the birth of his Child) she seemed\\r\\nto take no pains to prevent that affection from ever diminushing. Our\\r\\nvisits therefore to Dunbeath, were now less frequent and by far less\\r\\nagreable than they used to be. Our absence was however never either\\r\\nmentioned or lamented by Louisa who in the society of young Danvers\\r\\nwith whom she became acquainted at Aberdeen (he was at one of the\\r\\nUniversities there,) felt infinitely happier than in that of Matilda and\\r\\nyour freind, tho' there certainly never were pleasanter girls than we\\r\\nare. You know the sad end of all Lesleys connubial happiness; I will not\\r\\nrepeat it--. Adeiu my dear Charlotte; although I have not yet mentioned\\r\\nanything of the matter, I hope you will do me the justice to beleive\\r\\nthat I THINK and FEEL, a great deal for your Sisters affliction. I do\\r\\nnot doubt but that the healthy air of the Bristol downs will intirely\\r\\nremove it, by erasing from her Mind the remembrance of Henry. I am my\\r\\ndear Charlotte yrs ever M. L.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the FOURTH From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY Bristol\\r\\nFebruary 27th\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Dear Peggy I have but just received your letter, which being directed\\r\\nto Sussex while I was at Bristol was obliged to be forwarded to me here,\\r\\nand from some unaccountable Delay, has but this instant reached me--.\\r\\nI return you many thanks for the account it contains of Lesley's\\r\\nacquaintance, Love and Marriage with Louisa, which has not the less\\r\\nentertained me for having often been repeated to me before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have the satisfaction of informing you that we have every reason to\\r\\nimagine our pantry is by this time nearly cleared, as we left Particular\\r\\norders with the servants to eat as hard as they possibly could, and to\\r\\ncall in a couple of Chairwomen to assist them. We brought a cold Pigeon\\r\\npye, a cold turkey, a cold tongue, and half a dozen Jellies with us,\\r\\nwhich we were lucky enough with the help of our Landlady, her husband,\\r\\nand their three children, to get rid of, in less than two days after\\r\\nour arrival. Poor Eloisa is still so very indifferent both in Health and\\r\\nSpirits, that I very much fear, the air of the Bristol downs, healthy as\\r\\nit is, has not been able to drive poor Henry from her remembrance.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou ask me whether your new Mother in law is handsome and amiable--I\\r\\nwill now give you an exact description of her bodily and mental charms.\\r\\nShe is short, and extremely well made; is naturally pale, but rouges a\\r\\ngood deal; has fine eyes, and fine teeth, as she will take care to let\\r\\nyou know as soon as she sees you, and is altogether very pretty. She is\\r\\nremarkably good-tempered when she has her own way, and very lively when\\r\\nshe is not out of humour. She is naturally extravagant and not very\\r\\naffected; she never reads anything but the letters she receives from me,\\r\\nand never writes anything but her answers to them. She plays, sings and\\r\\nDances, but has no taste for either, and excells in none, tho' she says\\r\\nshe is passionately fond of all. Perhaps you may flatter me so far as to\\r\\nbe surprised that one of whom I speak with so little affection should\\r\\nbe my particular freind; but to tell you the truth, our freindship arose\\r\\nrather from Caprice on her side than Esteem on mine. We spent two or\\r\\nthree days together with a Lady in Berkshire with whom we both happened\\r\\nto be connected--. During our visit, the Weather being remarkably bad,\\r\\nand our party particularly stupid, she was so good as to conceive\\r\\na violent partiality for me, which very soon settled in a downright\\r\\nFreindship and ended in an established correspondence. She is probably\\r\\nby this time as tired of me, as I am of her; but as she is too Polite\\r\\nand I am too civil to say so, our letters are still as frequent and\\r\\naffectionate as ever, and our Attachment as firm and sincere as when it\\r\\nfirst commenced. As she had a great taste for the pleasures of London,\\r\\nand of Brighthelmstone, she will I dare say find some difficulty in\\r\\nprevailing on herself even to satisfy the curiosity I dare say she feels\\r\\nof beholding you, at the expence of quitting those favourite haunts of\\r\\nDissipation, for the melancholy tho' venerable gloom of the castle you\\r\\ninhabit. Perhaps however if she finds her health impaired by too much\\r\\namusement, she may acquire fortitude sufficient to undertake a Journey\\r\\nto Scotland in the hope of its Proving at least beneficial to her\\r\\nhealth, if not conducive to her happiness. Your fears I am sorry to say,\\r\\nconcerning your father's extravagance, your own fortunes, your Mothers\\r\\nJewels and your Sister's consequence, I should suppose are but too well\\r\\nfounded. My freind herself has four thousand pounds, and will probably\\r\\nspend nearly as much every year in Dress and Public places, if she can\\r\\nget it--she will certainly not endeavour to reclaim Sir George from the\\r\\nmanner of living to which he has been so long accustomed, and there is\\r\\ntherefore some reason to fear that you will be very well off, if you get\\r\\nany fortune at all. The Jewels I should imagine too will undoubtedly be\\r\\nhers, and there is too much reason to think that she will preside at\\r\\nher Husbands table in preference to his Daughter. But as so melancholy a\\r\\nsubject must necessarily extremely distress you, I will no longer dwell\\r\\non it--.\\r\\n\\r\\nEloisa's indisposition has brought us to Bristol at so unfashionable a\\r\\nseason of the year, that we have actually seen but one genteel family\\r\\nsince we came. Mr and Mrs Marlowe are very agreable people; the ill\\r\\nhealth of their little boy occasioned their arrival here; you may\\r\\nimagine that being the only family with whom we can converse, we are\\r\\nof course on a footing of intimacy with them; we see them indeed almost\\r\\nevery day, and dined with them yesterday. We spent a very pleasant\\r\\nDay, and had a very good Dinner, tho' to be sure the Veal was terribly\\r\\nunderdone, and the Curry had no seasoning. I could not help wishing\\r\\nall dinner-time that I had been at the dressing it--. A brother of Mrs\\r\\nMarlowe, Mr Cleveland is with them at present; he is a good-looking\\r\\nyoung Man, and seems to have a good deal to say for himself. I tell\\r\\nEloisa that she should set her cap at him, but she does not at all\\r\\nseem to relish the proposal. I should like to see the girl married and\\r\\nCleveland has a very good estate. Perhaps you may wonder that I do not\\r\\nconsider myself as well as my Sister in my matrimonial Projects; but\\r\\nto tell you the truth I never wish to act a more principal part at a\\r\\nWedding than the superintending and directing the Dinner, and therefore\\r\\nwhile I can get any of my acquaintance to marry for me, I shall never\\r\\nthink of doing it myself, as I very much suspect that I should not have\\r\\nso much time for dressing my own Wedding-dinner, as for dressing that of\\r\\nmy freinds. Yours sincerely C. L.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the FIFTH Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL\\r\\nLesley-Castle March 18th\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the same day that I received your last kind letter, Matilda received\\r\\none from Sir George which was dated from Edinburgh, and informed us that\\r\\nhe should do himself the pleasure of introducing Lady Lesley to us on\\r\\nthe following evening. This as you may suppose considerably surprised\\r\\nus, particularly as your account of her Ladyship had given us reason to\\r\\nimagine there was little chance of her visiting Scotland at a time that\\r\\nLondon must be so gay. As it was our business however to be delighted at\\r\\nsuch a mark of condescension as a visit from Sir George and Lady Lesley,\\r\\nwe prepared to return them an answer expressive of the happiness we\\r\\nenjoyed in expectation of such a Blessing, when luckily recollecting\\r\\nthat as they were to reach the Castle the next Evening, it would be\\r\\nimpossible for my father to receive it before he left Edinburgh, we\\r\\ncontented ourselves with leaving them to suppose that we were as happy\\r\\nas we ought to be. At nine in the Evening on the following day,\\r\\nthey came, accompanied by one of Lady Lesleys brothers. Her Ladyship\\r\\nperfectly answers the description you sent me of her, except that I do\\r\\nnot think her so pretty as you seem to consider her. She has not a\\r\\nbad face, but there is something so extremely unmajestic in her little\\r\\ndiminutive figure, as to render her in comparison with the elegant\\r\\nheight of Matilda and Myself, an insignificant Dwarf. Her curiosity to\\r\\nsee us (which must have been great to bring her more than four hundred\\r\\nmiles) being now perfectly gratified, she already begins to mention\\r\\ntheir return to town, and has desired us to accompany her. We cannot\\r\\nrefuse her request since it is seconded by the commands of our Father,\\r\\nand thirded by the entreaties of Mr. Fitzgerald who is certainly one\\r\\nof the most pleasing young Men, I ever beheld. It is not yet determined\\r\\nwhen we are to go, but when ever we do we shall certainly take our\\r\\nlittle Louisa with us. Adeiu my dear Charlotte; Matilda unites in best\\r\\nwishes to you, and Eloisa, with yours ever M. L.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the SIXTH LADY LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL Lesley-Castle\\r\\nMarch 20th\\r\\n\\r\\nWe arrived here my sweet Freind about a fortnight ago, and I already\\r\\nheartily repent that I ever left our charming House in Portman-square\\r\\nfor such a dismal old weather-beaten Castle as this. You can form no\\r\\nidea sufficiently hideous, of its dungeon-like form. It is actually\\r\\nperched upon a Rock to appearance so totally inaccessible, that I\\r\\nexpected to have been pulled up by a rope; and sincerely repented having\\r\\ngratified my curiosity to behold my Daughters at the expence of being\\r\\nobliged to enter their prison in so dangerous and ridiculous a manner.\\r\\nBut as soon as I once found myself safely arrived in the inside of\\r\\nthis tremendous building, I comforted myself with the hope of having my\\r\\nspirits revived, by the sight of two beautifull girls, such as the Miss\\r\\nLesleys had been represented to me, at Edinburgh. But here again, I\\r\\nmet with nothing but Disappointment and Surprise. Matilda and Margaret\\r\\nLesley are two great, tall, out of the way, over-grown, girls, just of\\r\\na proper size to inhabit a Castle almost as large in comparison as\\r\\nthemselves. I wish my dear Charlotte that you could but behold these\\r\\nScotch giants; I am sure they would frighten you out of your wits.\\r\\nThey will do very well as foils to myself, so I have invited them to\\r\\naccompany me to London where I hope to be in the course of a fortnight.\\r\\nBesides these two fair Damsels, I found a little humoured Brat here who\\r\\nI beleive is some relation to them, they told me who she was, and gave\\r\\nme a long rigmerole story of her father and a Miss SOMEBODY which I have\\r\\nentirely forgot. I hate scandal and detest Children. I have been plagued\\r\\never since I came here with tiresome visits from a parcel of Scotch\\r\\nwretches, with terrible hard-names; they were so civil, gave me so many\\r\\ninvitations, and talked of coming again so soon, that I could not help\\r\\naffronting them. I suppose I shall not see them any more, and yet as\\r\\na family party we are so stupid, that I do not know what to do with\\r\\nmyself. These girls have no Music, but Scotch airs, no Drawings but\\r\\nScotch Mountains, and no Books but Scotch Poems--and I hate everything\\r\\nScotch. In general I can spend half the Day at my toilett with a great\\r\\ndeal of pleasure, but why should I dress here, since there is not a\\r\\ncreature in the House whom I have any wish to please. I have just had\\r\\na conversation with my Brother in which he has greatly offended me, and\\r\\nwhich as I have nothing more entertaining to send you I will gave you\\r\\nthe particulars of. You must know that I have for these 4 or 5 Days past\\r\\nstrongly suspected William of entertaining a partiality to my eldest\\r\\nDaughter. I own indeed that had I been inclined to fall in love with any\\r\\nwoman, I should not have made choice of Matilda Lesley for the object\\r\\nof my passion; for there is nothing I hate so much as a tall Woman: but\\r\\nhowever there is no accounting for some men's taste and as William is\\r\\nhimself nearly six feet high, it is not wonderful that he should be\\r\\npartial to that height. Now as I have a very great affection for my\\r\\nBrother and should be extremely sorry to see him unhappy, which I\\r\\nsuppose he means to be if he cannot marry Matilda, as moreover I know\\r\\nthat his circumstances will not allow him to marry any one without a\\r\\nfortune, and that Matilda's is entirely dependant on her Father, who\\r\\nwill neither have his own inclination nor my permission to give her\\r\\nanything at present, I thought it would be doing a good-natured action\\r\\nby my Brother to let him know as much, in order that he might choose\\r\\nfor himself, whether to conquer his passion, or Love and Despair.\\r\\nAccordingly finding myself this Morning alone with him in one of the\\r\\nhorrid old rooms of this Castle, I opened the cause to him in the\\r\\nfollowing Manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell my dear William what do you think of these girls? for my part, I\\r\\ndo not find them so plain as I expected: but perhaps you may think me\\r\\npartial to the Daughters of my Husband and perhaps you are right--They\\r\\nare indeed so very like Sir George that it is natural to think\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Dear Susan (cried he in a tone of the greatest amazement) You do not\\r\\nreally think they bear the least resemblance to their Father! He is so\\r\\nvery plain!--but I beg your pardon--I had entirely forgotten to whom I\\r\\nwas speaking--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! pray dont mind me; (replied I) every one knows Sir George is\\r\\nhorribly ugly, and I assure you I always thought him a fright.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou surprise me extremely (answered William) by what you say both with\\r\\nrespect to Sir George and his Daughters. You cannot think your Husband\\r\\nso deficient in personal Charms as you speak of, nor can you surely see\\r\\nany resemblance between him and the Miss Lesleys who are in my opinion\\r\\nperfectly unlike him and perfectly Handsome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf that is your opinion with regard to the girls it certainly is no\\r\\nproof of their Fathers beauty, for if they are perfectly unlike him and\\r\\nvery handsome at the same time, it is natural to suppose that he is very\\r\\nplain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy no means, (said he) for what may be pretty in a Woman, may be very\\r\\nunpleasing in a Man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you yourself (replied I) but a few minutes ago allowed him to be\\r\\nvery plain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMen are no Judges of Beauty in their own Sex.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (said he).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNeither Men nor Women can think Sir George tolerable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well, (said he) we will not dispute about HIS Beauty, but your\\r\\nopinion of his DAUGHTERS is surely very singular, for if I understood\\r\\nyou right, you said you did not find them so plain as you expected to\\r\\ndo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, do YOU find them plainer then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (said I).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can scarcely beleive you to be serious (returned he) when you speak\\r\\nof their persons in so extroidinary a Manner. Do not you think the Miss\\r\\nLesleys are two very handsome young Women?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLord! No! (cried I) I think them terribly plain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlain! (replied He) My dear Susan, you cannot really think so! Why\\r\\nwhat single Feature in the face of either of them, can you possibly find\\r\\nfault with?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! trust me for that; (replied I). Come I will begin with the\\r\\neldest--with Matilda. Shall I, William?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (I looked as cunning as I could\\r\\nwhen I said it, in order to shame him).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are so much alike (said he) that I should suppose the faults of\\r\\none, would be the faults of both.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then, in the first place; they are both so horribly tall!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are TALLER than you are indeed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (said he with a saucy smile.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay, (said I), I know nothing of that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, but (he continued) tho' they may be above the common size, their\\r\\nfigures are perfectly elegant; and as to their faces, their Eyes are\\r\\nbeautifull.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never can think such tremendous, knock-me-down figures in the least\\r\\ndegree elegant, and as for their eyes, they are so tall that I never\\r\\ncould strain my neck enough to look at them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay, (replied he) I know not whether you may not be in the right in not\\r\\nattempting it, for perhaps they might dazzle you with their Lustre.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Certainly. (said I, with the greatest complacency, for I assure\\r\\nyou my dearest Charlotte I was not in the least offended tho' by what\\r\\nfollowed, one would suppose that William was conscious of having given\\r\\nme just cause to be so, for coming up to me and taking my hand, he said)\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must not look so grave Susan; you will make me fear I have offended\\r\\nyou!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOffended me! Dear Brother, how came such a thought in your head!\\r\\n(returned I) No really! I assure you that I am not in the least\\r\\nsurprised at your being so warm an advocate for the Beauty of these\\r\\ngirls.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, but (interrupted William) remember that we have not yet\\r\\nconcluded our dispute concerning them. What fault do you find with their\\r\\ncomplexion?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are so horridly pale.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey have always a little colour, and after any exercise it is\\r\\nconsiderably heightened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, but if there should ever happen to be any rain in this part of\\r\\nthe world, they will never be able raise more than their common\\r\\nstock--except indeed they amuse themselves with running up and Down\\r\\nthese horrid old galleries and Antichambers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, (replied my Brother in a tone of vexation, and glancing an\\r\\nimpertinent look at me) if they HAVE but little colour, at least, it is\\r\\nall their own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was too much my dear Charlotte, for I am certain that he had the\\r\\nimpudence by that look, of pretending to suspect the reality of mine.\\r\\nBut you I am sure will vindicate my character whenever you may hear\\r\\nit so cruelly aspersed, for you can witness how often I have protested\\r\\nagainst wearing Rouge, and how much I always told you I disliked it. And\\r\\nI assure you that my opinions are still the same.--. Well, not bearing\\r\\nto be so suspected by my Brother, I left the room immediately, and have\\r\\nbeen ever since in my own Dressing-room writing to you. What a long\\r\\nletter have I made of it! But you must not expect to receive such from\\r\\nme when I get to Town; for it is only at Lesley castle, that one has\\r\\ntime to write even to a Charlotte Lutterell.--. I was so much vexed by\\r\\nWilliam's glance, that I could not summon Patience enough, to stay and\\r\\ngive him that advice respecting his attachment to Matilda which had\\r\\nfirst induced me from pure Love to him to begin the conversation; and\\r\\nI am now so thoroughly convinced by it, of his violent passion for her,\\r\\nthat I am certain he would never hear reason on the subject, and I\\r\\nshall there fore give myself no more trouble either about him or his\\r\\nfavourite. Adeiu my dear girl--Yrs affectionately Susan L.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the SEVENTH From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY Bristol the\\r\\n27th of March\\r\\n\\r\\nI have received Letters from you and your Mother-in-law within this week\\r\\nwhich have greatly entertained me, as I find by them that you are both\\r\\ndownright jealous of each others Beauty. It is very odd that two pretty\\r\\nWomen tho' actually Mother and Daughter cannot be in the same House\\r\\nwithout falling out about their faces. Do be convinced that you are both\\r\\nperfectly handsome and say no more of the Matter. I suppose this letter\\r\\nmust be directed to Portman Square where probably (great as is your\\r\\naffection for Lesley Castle) you will not be sorry to find yourself. In\\r\\nspite of all that people may say about Green fields and the Country\\r\\nI was always of opinion that London and its amusements must be very\\r\\nagreable for a while, and should be very happy could my Mother's income\\r\\nallow her to jockey us into its Public-places, during Winter. I always\\r\\nlonged particularly to go to Vaux-hall, to see whether the cold Beef\\r\\nthere is cut so thin as it is reported, for I have a sly suspicion that\\r\\nfew people understand the art of cutting a slice of cold Beef so well\\r\\nas I do: nay it would be hard if I did not know something of the Matter,\\r\\nfor it was a part of my Education that I took by far the most pains\\r\\nwith. Mama always found me HER best scholar, tho' when Papa was\\r\\nalive Eloisa was HIS. Never to be sure were there two more different\\r\\nDispositions in the World. We both loved Reading. SHE preferred\\r\\nHistories, and I Receipts. She loved drawing, Pictures, and I drawing\\r\\nPullets. No one could sing a better song than she, and no one make a\\r\\nbetter Pye than I.--And so it has always continued since we have been\\r\\nno longer children. The only difference is that all disputes on the\\r\\nsuperior excellence of our Employments THEN so frequent are now no more.\\r\\nWe have for many years entered into an agreement always to admire\\r\\neach other's works; I never fail listening to HER Music, and she is as\\r\\nconstant in eating my pies. Such at least was the case till Henry Hervey\\r\\nmade his appearance in Sussex. Before the arrival of his Aunt in our\\r\\nneighbourhood where she established herself you know about a twelvemonth\\r\\nago, his visits to her had been at stated times, and of equal and\\r\\nsettled Duration; but on her removal to the Hall which is within a walk\\r\\nfrom our House, they became both more frequent and longer. This as you\\r\\nmay suppose could not be pleasing to Mrs Diana who is a professed enemy\\r\\nto everything which is not directed by Decorum and Formality, or which\\r\\nbears the least resemblance to Ease and Good-breeding. Nay so great was\\r\\nher aversion to her Nephews behaviour that I have often heard her give\\r\\nsuch hints of it before his face that had not Henry at such times been\\r\\nengaged in conversation with Eloisa, they must have caught his Attention\\r\\nand have very much distressed him. The alteration in my Sisters\\r\\nbehaviour which I have before hinted at, now took place. The Agreement\\r\\nwe had entered into of admiring each others productions she no\\r\\nlonger seemed to regard, and tho' I constantly applauded even every\\r\\nCountry-dance, she played, yet not even a pidgeon-pye of my making could\\r\\nobtain from her a single word of approbation. This was certainly enough\\r\\nto put any one in a Passion; however, I was as cool as a cream-cheese\\r\\nand having formed my plan and concerted a scheme of Revenge, I was\\r\\ndetermined to let her have her own way and not even to make her a single\\r\\nreproach. My scheme was to treat her as she treated me, and tho' she\\r\\nmight even draw my own Picture or play Malbrook (which is the only tune\\r\\nI ever really liked) not to say so much as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you Eloisa;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tho'\\r\\nI had for many years constantly hollowed whenever she played, BRAVO,\\r\\nBRAVISSIMO, ENCORE, DA CAPO, ALLEGRETTO, CON EXPRESSIONE, and POCO\\r\\nPRESTO with many other such outlandish words, all of them as Eloisa told\\r\\nme expressive of my Admiration; and so indeed I suppose they are, as I\\r\\nsee some of them in every Page of every Music book, being the sentiments\\r\\nI imagine of the composer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI executed my Plan with great Punctuality. I can not say success, for\\r\\nalas! my silence while she played seemed not in the least to displease\\r\\nher; on the contrary she actually said to me one day \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell Charlotte,\\r\\nI am very glad to find that you have at last left off that ridiculous\\r\\ncustom of applauding my Execution on the Harpsichord till you made\\r\\nmy head ake, and yourself hoarse. I feel very much obliged to you for\\r\\nkeeping your admiration to yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I never shall forget the very\\r\\nwitty answer I made to this speech. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEloisa (said I) I beg you would\\r\\nbe quite at your Ease with respect to all such fears in future, for\\r\\nbe assured that I shall always keep my admiration to myself and my own\\r\\npursuits and never extend it to yours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This was the only very severe\\r\\nthing I ever said in my Life; not but that I have often felt myself\\r\\nextremely satirical but it was the only time I ever made my feelings\\r\\npublic.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose there never were two Young people who had a greater affection\\r\\nfor each other than Henry and Eloisa; no, the Love of your Brother for\\r\\nMiss Burton could not be so strong tho' it might be more violent. You\\r\\nmay imagine therefore how provoked my Sister must have been to have\\r\\nhim play her such a trick. Poor girl! she still laments his Death with\\r\\nundiminished constancy, notwithstanding he has been dead more than six\\r\\nweeks; but some People mind such things more than others. The ill state\\r\\nof Health into which his loss has thrown her makes her so weak, and so\\r\\nunable to support the least exertion, that she has been in tears all\\r\\nthis Morning merely from having taken leave of Mrs. Marlowe who with her\\r\\nHusband, Brother and Child are to leave Bristol this morning. I am sorry\\r\\nto have them go because they are the only family with whom we have here\\r\\nany acquaintance, but I never thought of crying; to be sure Eloisa\\r\\nand Mrs Marlowe have always been more together than with me, and have\\r\\ntherefore contracted a kind of affection for each other, which does not\\r\\nmake Tears so inexcusable in them as they would be in me. The Marlowes\\r\\nare going to Town; Cliveland accompanies them; as neither Eloisa nor I\\r\\ncould catch him I hope you or Matilda may have better Luck. I know not\\r\\nwhen we shall leave Bristol, Eloisa's spirits are so low that she is\\r\\nvery averse to moving, and yet is certainly by no means mended by her\\r\\nresidence here. A week or two will I hope determine our Measures--in the\\r\\nmean time believe me and etc--and etc--Charlotte Lutterell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the EIGHTH Miss LUTTERELL to Mrs MARLOWE Bristol April 4th\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel myself greatly obliged to you my dear Emma for such a mark of\\r\\nyour affection as I flatter myself was conveyed in the proposal you made\\r\\nme of our Corresponding; I assure you that it will be a great releif to\\r\\nme to write to you and as long as my Health and Spirits will allow\\r\\nme, you will find me a very constant correspondent; I will not say\\r\\nan entertaining one, for you know my situation suffciently not to be\\r\\nignorant that in me Mirth would be improper and I know my own Heart too\\r\\nwell not to be sensible that it would be unnatural. You must not expect\\r\\nnews for we see no one with whom we are in the least acquainted, or in\\r\\nwhose proceedings we have any Interest. You must not expect scandal\\r\\nfor by the same rule we are equally debarred either from hearing or\\r\\ninventing it.--You must expect from me nothing but the melancholy\\r\\neffusions of a broken Heart which is ever reverting to the Happiness\\r\\nit once enjoyed and which ill supports its present wretchedness. The\\r\\nPossibility of being able to write, to speak, to you of my lost Henry\\r\\nwill be a luxury to me, and your goodness will not I know refuse to read\\r\\nwhat it will so much releive my Heart to write. I once thought that to\\r\\nhave what is in general called a Freind (I mean one of my own sex\\r\\nto whom I might speak with less reserve than to any other person)\\r\\nindependant of my sister would never be an object of my wishes, but how\\r\\nmuch was I mistaken! Charlotte is too much engrossed by two confidential\\r\\ncorrespondents of that sort, to supply the place of one to me, and I\\r\\nhope you will not think me girlishly romantic, when I say that to\\r\\nhave some kind and compassionate Freind who might listen to my sorrows\\r\\nwithout endeavouring to console me was what I had for some time wished\\r\\nfor, when our acquaintance with you, the intimacy which followed it and\\r\\nthe particular affectionate attention you paid me almost from the first,\\r\\ncaused me to entertain the flattering Idea of those attentions being\\r\\nimproved on a closer acquaintance into a Freindship which, if you were\\r\\nwhat my wishes formed you would be the greatest Happiness I could\\r\\nbe capable of enjoying. To find that such Hopes are realised is a\\r\\nsatisfaction indeed, a satisfaction which is now almost the only one I\\r\\ncan ever experience.--I feel myself so languid that I am sure were you\\r\\nwith me you would oblige me to leave off writing, and I cannot give you\\r\\na greater proof of my affection for you than by acting, as I know you\\r\\nwould wish me to do, whether Absent or Present. I am my dear Emmas\\r\\nsincere freind E. L.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the NINTH Mrs MARLOWE to Miss LUTTERELL Grosvenor Street, April\\r\\n10th\\r\\n\\r\\nNeed I say my dear Eloisa how wellcome your letter was to me I cannot\\r\\ngive a greater proof of the pleasure I received from it, or of the\\r\\nDesire I feel that our Correspondence may be regular and frequent than\\r\\nby setting you so good an example as I now do in answering it before the\\r\\nend of the week--. But do not imagine that I claim any merit in being\\r\\nso punctual; on the contrary I assure you, that it is a far greater\\r\\nGratification to me to write to you, than to spend the Evening either at\\r\\na Concert or a Ball. Mr Marlowe is so desirous of my appearing at some\\r\\nof the Public places every evening that I do not like to refuse him, but\\r\\nat the same time so much wish to remain at Home, that independant of\\r\\nthe Pleasure I experience in devoting any portion of my Time to my\\r\\nDear Eloisa, yet the Liberty I claim from having a letter to write of\\r\\nspending an Evening at home with my little Boy, you know me well enough\\r\\nto be sensible, will of itself be a sufficient Inducement (if one is\\r\\nnecessary) to my maintaining with Pleasure a Correspondence with you.\\r\\nAs to the subject of your letters to me, whether grave or merry, if they\\r\\nconcern you they must be equally interesting to me; not but that I think\\r\\nthe melancholy Indulgence of your own sorrows by repeating them and\\r\\ndwelling on them to me, will only encourage and increase them, and\\r\\nthat it will be more prudent in you to avoid so sad a subject; but yet\\r\\nknowing as I do what a soothing and melancholy Pleasure it must afford\\r\\nyou, I cannot prevail on myself to deny you so great an Indulgence, and\\r\\nwill only insist on your not expecting me to encourage you in it, by my\\r\\nown letters; on the contrary I intend to fill them with such lively Wit\\r\\nand enlivening Humour as shall even provoke a smile in the sweet but\\r\\nsorrowfull countenance of my Eloisa.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place you are to learn that I have met your sisters three\\r\\nfreinds Lady Lesley and her Daughters, twice in Public since I have been\\r\\nhere. I know you will be impatient to hear my opinion of the Beauty of\\r\\nthree Ladies of whom you have heard so much. Now, as you are too ill and\\r\\ntoo unhappy to be vain, I think I may venture to inform you that I\\r\\nlike none of their faces so well as I do your own. Yet they are all\\r\\nhandsome--Lady Lesley indeed I have seen before; her Daughters I beleive\\r\\nwould in general be said to have a finer face than her Ladyship, and yet\\r\\nwhat with the charms of a Blooming complexion, a little Affectation and\\r\\na great deal of small-talk, (in each of which she is superior to the\\r\\nyoung Ladies) she will I dare say gain herself as many admirers as the\\r\\nmore regular features of Matilda, and Margaret. I am sure you will agree\\r\\nwith me in saying that they can none of them be of a proper size for\\r\\nreal Beauty, when you know that two of them are taller and the other\\r\\nshorter than ourselves. In spite of this Defect (or rather by reason\\r\\nof it) there is something very noble and majestic in the figures of the\\r\\nMiss Lesleys, and something agreably lively in the appearance of their\\r\\npretty little Mother-in-law. But tho' one may be majestic and the other\\r\\nlively, yet the faces of neither possess that Bewitching sweetness of\\r\\nmy Eloisas, which her present languor is so far from diminushing. What\\r\\nwould my Husband and Brother say of us, if they knew all the fine things\\r\\nI have been saying to you in this letter. It is very hard that a pretty\\r\\nwoman is never to be told she is so by any one of her own sex without\\r\\nthat person's being suspected to be either her determined Enemy, or\\r\\nher professed Toad-eater. How much more amiable are women in that\\r\\nparticular! One man may say forty civil things to another without our\\r\\nsupposing that he is ever paid for it, and provided he does his Duty by\\r\\nour sex, we care not how Polite he is to his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Lutterell will be so good as to accept my compliments, Charlotte,\\r\\nmy Love, and Eloisa the best wishes for the recovery of her Health and\\r\\nSpirits that can be offered by her affectionate Freind E. Marlowe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am afraid this letter will be but a poor specimen of my Powers in the\\r\\nwitty way; and your opinion of them will not be greatly increased when I\\r\\nassure you that I have been as entertaining as I possibly could.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the TENTH From Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL\\r\\nPortman Square April 13th\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CHARLOTTE We left Lesley-Castle on the 28th of last Month,\\r\\nand arrived safely in London after a Journey of seven Days; I had the\\r\\npleasure of finding your Letter here waiting my Arrival, for which you\\r\\nhave my grateful Thanks. Ah! my dear Freind I every day more regret the\\r\\nserene and tranquil Pleasures of the Castle we have left, in exchange\\r\\nfor the uncertain and unequal Amusements of this vaunted City. Not that\\r\\nI will pretend to assert that these uncertain and unequal Amusements\\r\\nare in the least Degree unpleasing to me; on the contrary I enjoy them\\r\\nextremely and should enjoy them even more, were I not certain that every\\r\\nappearance I make in Public but rivetts the Chains of those unhappy\\r\\nBeings whose Passion it is impossible not to pity, tho' it is out of my\\r\\npower to return. In short my Dear Charlotte it is my sensibility for\\r\\nthe sufferings of so many amiable young Men, my Dislike of the extreme\\r\\nadmiration I meet with, and my aversion to being so celebrated both in\\r\\nPublic, in Private, in Papers, and in Printshops, that are the reasons\\r\\nwhy I cannot more fully enjoy, the Amusements so various and pleasing\\r\\nof London. How often have I wished that I possessed as little Personal\\r\\nBeauty as you do; that my figure were as inelegant; my face as unlovely;\\r\\nand my appearance as unpleasing as yours! But ah! what little chance\\r\\nis there of so desirable an Event; I have had the small-pox, and must\\r\\ntherefore submit to my unhappy fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am now going to intrust you my dear Charlotte with a secret which has\\r\\nlong disturbed the tranquility of my days, and which is of a kind to\\r\\nrequire the most inviolable Secrecy from you. Last Monday se'night\\r\\nMatilda and I accompanied Lady Lesley to a Rout at the Honourable Mrs\\r\\nKickabout's; we were escorted by Mr Fitzgerald who is a very amiable\\r\\nyoung Man in the main, tho' perhaps a little singular in his Taste--He\\r\\nis in love with Matilda--. We had scarcely paid our Compliments to the\\r\\nLady of the House and curtseyed to half a score different people when my\\r\\nAttention was attracted by the appearance of a Young Man the most lovely\\r\\nof his Sex, who at that moment entered the Room with another Gentleman\\r\\nand Lady. From the first moment I beheld him, I was certain that on him\\r\\ndepended the future Happiness of my Life. Imagine my surprise when he\\r\\nwas introduced to me by the name of Cleveland--I instantly recognised\\r\\nhim as the Brother of Mrs Marlowe, and the acquaintance of my Charlotte\\r\\nat Bristol. Mr and Mrs M. were the gentleman and Lady who accompanied\\r\\nhim. (You do not think Mrs Marlowe handsome?) The elegant address of Mr\\r\\nCleveland, his polished Manners and Delightful Bow, at once confirmed my\\r\\nattachment. He did not speak; but I can imagine everything he would have\\r\\nsaid, had he opened his Mouth. I can picture to myself the cultivated\\r\\nUnderstanding, the Noble sentiments, and elegant Language which would\\r\\nhave shone so conspicuous in the conversation of Mr Cleveland. The\\r\\napproach of Sir James Gower (one of my too numerous admirers) prevented\\r\\nthe Discovery of any such Powers, by putting an end to a Conversation we\\r\\nhad never commenced, and by attracting my attention to himself. But oh!\\r\\nhow inferior are the accomplishments of Sir James to those of his so\\r\\ngreatly envied Rival! Sir James is one of the most frequent of our\\r\\nVisitors, and is almost always of our Parties. We have since often met\\r\\nMr and Mrs Marlowe but no Cleveland--he is always engaged some where\\r\\nelse. Mrs Marlowe fatigues me to Death every time I see her by her\\r\\ntiresome Conversations about you and Eloisa. She is so stupid! I live in\\r\\nthe hope of seeing her irrisistable Brother to night, as we are going to\\r\\nLady Flambeaus, who is I know intimate with the Marlowes. Our party will\\r\\nbe Lady Lesley, Matilda, Fitzgerald, Sir James Gower, and myself. We see\\r\\nlittle of Sir George, who is almost always at the gaming-table. Ah! my\\r\\npoor Fortune where art thou by this time? We see more of Lady L. who\\r\\nalways makes her appearance (highly rouged) at Dinner-time. Alas! what\\r\\nDelightful Jewels will she be decked in this evening at Lady Flambeau's!\\r\\nYet I wonder how she can herself delight in wearing them; surely she\\r\\nmust be sensible of the ridiculous impropriety of loading her little\\r\\ndiminutive figure with such superfluous ornaments; is it possible that\\r\\nshe can not know how greatly superior an elegant simplicity is to the\\r\\nmost studied apparel? Would she but Present them to Matilda and me, how\\r\\ngreatly should we be obliged to her, How becoming would Diamonds be on\\r\\nour fine majestic figures! And how surprising it is that such an Idea\\r\\nshould never have occurred to HER. I am sure if I have reflected in this\\r\\nmanner once, I have fifty times. Whenever I see Lady Lesley dressed in\\r\\nthem such reflections immediately come across me. My own Mother's Jewels\\r\\ntoo! But I will say no more on so melancholy a subject--let me entertain\\r\\nyou with something more pleasing--Matilda had a letter this morning from\\r\\nLesley, by which we have the pleasure of finding that he is at Naples\\r\\nhas turned Roman-Catholic, obtained one of the Pope's Bulls for\\r\\nannulling his 1st Marriage and has since actually married a Neapolitan\\r\\nLady of great Rank and Fortune. He tells us moreover that much the same\\r\\nsort of affair has befallen his first wife the worthless Louisa who is\\r\\nlikewise at Naples had turned Roman-catholic, and is soon to be married\\r\\nto a Neapolitan Nobleman of great and Distinguished merit. He says,\\r\\nthat they are at present very good Freinds, have quite forgiven all\\r\\npast errors and intend in future to be very good Neighbours. He invites\\r\\nMatilda and me to pay him a visit to Italy and to bring him his little\\r\\nLouisa whom both her Mother, Step-mother, and himself are equally\\r\\ndesirous of beholding. As to our accepting his invitation, it is at\\r\\nPresent very uncertain; Lady Lesley advises us to go without loss of\\r\\ntime; Fitzgerald offers to escort us there, but Matilda has some doubts\\r\\nof the Propriety of such a scheme--she owns it would be very agreable.\\r\\nI am certain she likes the Fellow. My Father desires us not to be in a\\r\\nhurry, as perhaps if we wait a few months both he and Lady Lesley will\\r\\ndo themselves the pleasure of attending us. Lady Lesley says no, that\\r\\nnothing will ever tempt her to forego the Amusements of Brighthelmstone\\r\\nfor a Journey to Italy merely to see our Brother. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo (says the\\r\\ndisagreable Woman) I have once in my life been fool enough to travel I\\r\\ndont know how many hundred Miles to see two of the Family, and I found\\r\\nit did not answer, so Deuce take me, if ever I am so foolish again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So\\r\\nsays her Ladyship, but Sir George still Perseveres in saying that\\r\\nperhaps in a month or two, they may accompany us. Adeiu my Dear\\r\\nCharlotte Yrs faithful Margaret Lesley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HISTORY OF ENGLAND\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM THE REIGN OF HENRY THE 4TH TO THE DEATH OF CHARLES THE 1ST\\r\\n\\r\\nBY A PARTIAL, PREJUDICED, AND IGNORANT HISTORIAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Miss Austen, eldest daughter of the Rev. George Austen, this work is\\r\\ninscribed with all due respect by THE AUTHOR.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nN.B. There will be very few Dates in this History.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HISTORY OF ENGLAND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHENRY the 4th\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry the 4th ascended the throne of England much to his own\\r\\nsatisfaction in the year 1399, after having prevailed on his cousin and\\r\\npredecessor Richard the 2nd, to resign it to him, and to retire for the\\r\\nrest of his life to Pomfret Castle, where he happened to be murdered.\\r\\nIt is to be supposed that Henry was married, since he had certainly four\\r\\nsons, but it is not in my power to inform the Reader who was his wife.\\r\\nBe this as it may, he did not live for ever, but falling ill, his son\\r\\nthe Prince of Wales came and took away the crown; whereupon the King\\r\\nmade a long speech, for which I must refer the Reader to Shakespear's\\r\\nPlays, and the Prince made a still longer. Things being thus settled\\r\\nbetween them the King died, and was succeeded by his son Henry who had\\r\\npreviously beat Sir William Gascoigne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHENRY the 5th\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Prince after he succeeded to the throne grew quite reformed and\\r\\namiable, forsaking all his dissipated companions, and never thrashing\\r\\nSir William again. During his reign, Lord Cobham was burnt alive, but I\\r\\nforget what for. His Majesty then turned his thoughts to France, where\\r\\nhe went and fought the famous Battle of Agincourt. He afterwards married\\r\\nthe King's daughter Catherine, a very agreable woman by Shakespear's\\r\\naccount. In spite of all this however he died, and was succeeded by his\\r\\nson Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHENRY the 6th\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot say much for this Monarch's sense. Nor would I if I could, for\\r\\nhe was a Lancastrian. I suppose you know all about the Wars between him\\r\\nand the Duke of York who was of the right side; if you do not, you had\\r\\nbetter read some other History, for I shall not be very diffuse in this,\\r\\nmeaning by it only to vent my spleen AGAINST, and shew my Hatred TO all\\r\\nthose people whose parties or principles do not suit with mine, and not\\r\\nto give information. This King married Margaret of Anjou, a Woman whose\\r\\ndistresses and misfortunes were so great as almost to make me who hate\\r\\nher, pity her. It was in this reign that Joan of Arc lived and made such\\r\\na ROW among the English. They should not have burnt her--but they did.\\r\\nThere were several Battles between the Yorkists and Lancastrians, in\\r\\nwhich the former (as they ought) usually conquered. At length they were\\r\\nentirely overcome; The King was murdered--The Queen was sent home--and\\r\\nEdward the 4th ascended the Throne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEDWARD the 4th\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Monarch was famous only for his Beauty and his Courage, of which\\r\\nthe Picture we have here given of him, and his undaunted Behaviour\\r\\nin marrying one Woman while he was engaged to another, are sufficient\\r\\nproofs. His Wife was Elizabeth Woodville, a Widow who, poor Woman! was\\r\\nafterwards confined in a Convent by that Monster of Iniquity and Avarice\\r\\nHenry the 7th. One of Edward's Mistresses was Jane Shore, who has had\\r\\na play written about her, but it is a tragedy and therefore not worth\\r\\nreading. Having performed all these noble actions, his Majesty died, and\\r\\nwas succeeded by his son.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEDWARD the 5th\\r\\n\\r\\nThis unfortunate Prince lived so little a while that nobody had him to\\r\\ndraw his picture. He was murdered by his Uncle's Contrivance, whose name\\r\\nwas Richard the 3rd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRICHARD the 3rd\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Character of this Prince has been in general very severely treated\\r\\nby Historians, but as he was a YORK, I am rather inclined to suppose him\\r\\na very respectable Man. It has indeed been confidently asserted that he\\r\\nkilled his two Nephews and his Wife, but it has also been declared that\\r\\nhe did not kill his two Nephews, which I am inclined to beleive true;\\r\\nand if this is the case, it may also be affirmed that he did not kill\\r\\nhis Wife, for if Perkin Warbeck was really the Duke of York, why might\\r\\nnot Lambert Simnel be the Widow of Richard. Whether innocent or guilty,\\r\\nhe did not reign long in peace, for Henry Tudor E. of Richmond as great\\r\\na villain as ever lived, made a great fuss about getting the Crown and\\r\\nhaving killed the King at the battle of Bosworth, he succeeded to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHENRY the 7th\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Monarch soon after his accession married the Princess Elizabeth of\\r\\nYork, by which alliance he plainly proved that he thought his own right\\r\\ninferior to hers, tho' he pretended to the contrary. By this Marriage he\\r\\nhad two sons and two daughters, the elder of which Daughters was married\\r\\nto the King of Scotland and had the happiness of being grandmother\\r\\nto one of the first Characters in the World. But of HER, I shall have\\r\\noccasion to speak more at large in future. The youngest, Mary, married\\r\\nfirst the King of France and secondly the D. of Suffolk, by whom she had\\r\\none daughter, afterwards the Mother of Lady Jane Grey, who tho' inferior\\r\\nto her lovely Cousin the Queen of Scots, was yet an amiable young woman\\r\\nand famous for reading Greek while other people were hunting. It was in\\r\\nthe reign of Henry the 7th that Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel before\\r\\nmentioned made their appearance, the former of whom was set in the\\r\\nstocks, took shelter in Beaulieu Abbey, and was beheaded with the Earl\\r\\nof Warwick, and the latter was taken into the Kings kitchen. His Majesty\\r\\ndied and was succeeded by his son Henry whose only merit was his not\\r\\nbeing quite so bad as his daughter Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHENRY the 8th\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be an affront to my Readers were I to suppose that they were\\r\\nnot as well acquainted with the particulars of this King's reign as I am\\r\\nmyself. It will therefore be saving THEM the task of reading again what\\r\\nthey have read before, and MYSELF the trouble of writing what I do not\\r\\nperfectly recollect, by giving only a slight sketch of the principal\\r\\nEvents which marked his reign. Among these may be ranked Cardinal\\r\\nWolsey's telling the father Abbott of Leicester Abbey that \\xe2\\x80\\x9che was come\\r\\nto lay his bones among them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the reformation in Religion and the King's\\r\\nriding through the streets of London with Anna Bullen. It is however\\r\\nbut Justice, and my Duty to declare that this amiable Woman was entirely\\r\\ninnocent of the Crimes with which she was accused, and of which her\\r\\nBeauty, her Elegance, and her Sprightliness were sufficient proofs, not\\r\\nto mention her solemn Protestations of Innocence, the weakness of the\\r\\nCharges against her, and the King's Character; all of which add some\\r\\nconfirmation, tho' perhaps but slight ones when in comparison with those\\r\\nbefore alledged in her favour. Tho' I do not profess giving many dates,\\r\\nyet as I think it proper to give some and shall of course make choice\\r\\nof those which it is most necessary for the Reader to know, I think it\\r\\nright to inform him that her letter to the King was dated on the 6th of\\r\\nMay. The Crimes and Cruelties of this Prince, were too numerous to be\\r\\nmentioned, (as this history I trust has fully shown;) and nothing can\\r\\nbe said in his vindication, but that his abolishing Religious Houses and\\r\\nleaving them to the ruinous depredations of time has been of infinite\\r\\nuse to the landscape of England in general, which probably was a\\r\\nprincipal motive for his doing it, since otherwise why should a Man who\\r\\nwas of no Religion himself be at so much trouble to abolish one which\\r\\nhad for ages been established in the Kingdom. His Majesty's 5th Wife\\r\\nwas the Duke of Norfolk's Neice who, tho' universally acquitted of the\\r\\ncrimes for which she was beheaded, has been by many people supposed to\\r\\nhave led an abandoned life before her Marriage--of this however I have\\r\\nmany doubts, since she was a relation of that noble Duke of Norfolk who\\r\\nwas so warm in the Queen of Scotland's cause, and who at last fell a\\r\\nvictim to it. The Kings last wife contrived to survive him, but with\\r\\ndifficulty effected it. He was succeeded by his only son Edward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEDWARD the 6th\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this prince was only nine years old at the time of his Father's\\r\\ndeath, he was considered by many people as too young to govern, and the\\r\\nlate King happening to be of the same opinion, his mother's Brother the\\r\\nDuke of Somerset was chosen Protector of the realm during his minority.\\r\\nThis Man was on the whole of a very amiable Character, and is somewhat\\r\\nof a favourite with me, tho' I would by no means pretend to affirm that\\r\\nhe was equal to those first of Men Robert Earl of Essex, Delamere, or\\r\\nGilpin. He was beheaded, of which he might with reason have been proud,\\r\\nhad he known that such was the death of Mary Queen of Scotland; but\\r\\nas it was impossible that he should be conscious of what had never\\r\\nhappened, it does not appear that he felt particularly delighted with\\r\\nthe manner of it. After his decease the Duke of Northumberland had the\\r\\ncare of the King and the Kingdom, and performed his trust of both so\\r\\nwell that the King died and the Kingdom was left to his daughter in law\\r\\nthe Lady Jane Grey, who has been already mentioned as reading Greek.\\r\\nWhether she really understood that language or whether such a study\\r\\nproceeded only from an excess of vanity for which I beleive she was\\r\\nalways rather remarkable, is uncertain. Whatever might be the cause,\\r\\nshe preserved the same appearance of knowledge, and contempt of what\\r\\nwas generally esteemed pleasure, during the whole of her life, for\\r\\nshe declared herself displeased with being appointed Queen, and while\\r\\nconducting to the scaffold, she wrote a sentence in Latin and another in\\r\\nGreek on seeing the dead Body of her Husband accidentally passing that\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMARY\\r\\n\\r\\nThis woman had the good luck of being advanced to the throne of England,\\r\\nin spite of the superior pretensions, Merit, and Beauty of her Cousins\\r\\nMary Queen of Scotland and Jane Grey. Nor can I pity the Kingdom for the\\r\\nmisfortunes they experienced during her Reign, since they fully deserved\\r\\nthem, for having allowed her to succeed her Brother--which was a double\\r\\npeice of folly, since they might have foreseen that as she died without\\r\\nchildren, she would be succeeded by that disgrace to humanity, that\\r\\npest of society, Elizabeth. Many were the people who fell martyrs to the\\r\\nprotestant Religion during her reign; I suppose not fewer than a dozen.\\r\\nShe married Philip King of Spain who in her sister's reign was famous\\r\\nfor building Armadas. She died without issue, and then the dreadful\\r\\nmoment came in which the destroyer of all comfort, the deceitful\\r\\nBetrayer of trust reposed in her, and the Murderess of her Cousin\\r\\nsucceeded to the Throne.----\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the peculiar misfortune of this Woman to have bad\\r\\nMinisters---Since wicked as she herself was, she could not have\\r\\ncommitted such extensive mischeif, had not these vile and abandoned Men\\r\\nconnived at, and encouraged her in her Crimes. I know that it has by\\r\\nmany people been asserted and beleived that Lord Burleigh, Sir Francis\\r\\nWalsingham, and the rest of those who filled the cheif offices of State\\r\\nwere deserving, experienced, and able Ministers. But oh! how blinded\\r\\nsuch writers and such Readers must be to true Merit, to Merit despised,\\r\\nneglected and defamed, if they can persist in such opinions when they\\r\\nreflect that these men, these boasted men were such scandals to their\\r\\nCountry and their sex as to allow and assist their Queen in confining\\r\\nfor the space of nineteen years, a WOMAN who if the claims of\\r\\nRelationship and Merit were of no avail, yet as a Queen and as one who\\r\\ncondescended to place confidence in her, had every reason to expect\\r\\nassistance and protection; and at length in allowing Elizabeth to bring\\r\\nthis amiable Woman to an untimely, unmerited, and scandalous Death. Can\\r\\nany one if he reflects but for a moment on this blot, this everlasting\\r\\nblot upon their understanding and their Character, allow any praise to\\r\\nLord Burleigh or Sir Francis Walsingham? Oh! what must this bewitching\\r\\nPrincess whose only freind was then the Duke of Norfolk, and whose\\r\\nonly ones now Mr Whitaker, Mrs Lefroy, Mrs Knight and myself, who was\\r\\nabandoned by her son, confined by her Cousin, abused, reproached and\\r\\nvilified by all, what must not her most noble mind have suffered when\\r\\ninformed that Elizabeth had given orders for her Death! Yet she bore\\r\\nit with a most unshaken fortitude, firm in her mind; constant in her\\r\\nReligion; and prepared herself to meet the cruel fate to which she\\r\\nwas doomed, with a magnanimity that would alone proceed from conscious\\r\\nInnocence. And yet could you Reader have beleived it possible that\\r\\nsome hardened and zealous Protestants have even abused her for that\\r\\nsteadfastness in the Catholic Religion which reflected on her so\\r\\nmuch credit? But this is a striking proof of THEIR narrow souls and\\r\\nprejudiced Judgements who accuse her. She was executed in the Great Hall\\r\\nat Fortheringay Castle (sacred Place!) on Wednesday the 8th of February\\r\\n1586--to the everlasting Reproach of Elizabeth, her Ministers, and of\\r\\nEngland in general. It may not be unnecessary before I entirely conclude\\r\\nmy account of this ill-fated Queen, to observe that she had been accused\\r\\nof several crimes during the time of her reigning in Scotland, of which\\r\\nI now most seriously do assure my Reader that she was entirely innocent;\\r\\nhaving never been guilty of anything more than Imprudencies into which\\r\\nshe was betrayed by the openness of her Heart, her Youth, and her\\r\\nEducation. Having I trust by this assurance entirely done away every\\r\\nSuspicion and every doubt which might have arisen in the Reader's mind,\\r\\nfrom what other Historians have written of her, I shall proceed to\\r\\nmention the remaining Events that marked Elizabeth's reign. It was about\\r\\nthis time that Sir Francis Drake the first English Navigator who sailed\\r\\nround the World, lived, to be the ornament of his Country and his\\r\\nprofession. Yet great as he was, and justly celebrated as a sailor,\\r\\nI cannot help foreseeing that he will be equalled in this or the next\\r\\nCentury by one who tho' now but young, already promises to answer all\\r\\nthe ardent and sanguine expectations of his Relations and Freinds,\\r\\namongst whom I may class the amiable Lady to whom this work is\\r\\ndedicated, and my no less amiable self.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough of a different profession, and shining in a different sphere of\\r\\nLife, yet equally conspicuous in the Character of an Earl, as Drake was\\r\\nin that of a Sailor, was Robert Devereux Lord Essex. This unfortunate\\r\\nyoung Man was not unlike in character to that equally unfortunate\\r\\none FREDERIC DELAMERE. The simile may be carried still farther, and\\r\\nElizabeth the torment of Essex may be compared to the Emmeline of\\r\\nDelamere. It would be endless to recount the misfortunes of this noble\\r\\nand gallant Earl. It is sufficient to say that he was beheaded on the\\r\\n25th of Feb, after having been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, after having\\r\\nclapped his hand on his sword, and after performing many other services\\r\\nto his Country. Elizabeth did not long survive his loss, and died so\\r\\nmiserable that were it not an injury to the memory of Mary I should pity\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJAMES the 1st\\r\\n\\r\\nThough this King had some faults, among which and as the most principal,\\r\\nwas his allowing his Mother's death, yet considered on the whole I\\r\\ncannot help liking him. He married Anne of Denmark, and had several\\r\\nChildren; fortunately for him his eldest son Prince Henry died before\\r\\nhis father or he might have experienced the evils which befell his\\r\\nunfortunate Brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I am myself partial to the roman catholic religion, it is with\\r\\ninfinite regret that I am obliged to blame the Behaviour of any Member\\r\\nof it: yet Truth being I think very excusable in an Historian, I am\\r\\nnecessitated to say that in this reign the roman Catholics of England\\r\\ndid not behave like Gentlemen to the protestants. Their Behaviour\\r\\nindeed to the Royal Family and both Houses of Parliament might justly\\r\\nbe considered by them as very uncivil, and even Sir Henry Percy tho'\\r\\ncertainly the best bred man of the party, had none of that general\\r\\npoliteness which is so universally pleasing, as his attentions were\\r\\nentirely confined to Lord Mounteagle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter Raleigh flourished in this and the preceeding reign, and is\\r\\nby many people held in great veneration and respect--But as he was an\\r\\nenemy of the noble Essex, I have nothing to say in praise of him, and\\r\\nmust refer all those who may wish to be acquainted with the particulars\\r\\nof his life, to Mr Sheridan's play of the Critic, where they will\\r\\nfind many interesting anecdotes as well of him as of his friend Sir\\r\\nChristopher Hatton.--His Majesty was of that amiable disposition which\\r\\ninclines to Freindship, and in such points was possessed of a keener\\r\\npenetration in discovering Merit than many other people. I once heard an\\r\\nexcellent Sharade on a Carpet, of which the subject I am now on reminds\\r\\nme, and as I think it may afford my Readers some amusement to FIND IT\\r\\nOUT, I shall here take the liberty of presenting it to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSHARADE My first is what my second was to King James the 1st, and you\\r\\ntread on my whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal favourites of his Majesty were Car, who was afterwards\\r\\ncreated Earl of Somerset and whose name perhaps may have some share\\r\\nin the above mentioned Sharade, and George Villiers afterwards Duke of\\r\\nBuckingham. On his Majesty's death he was succeeded by his son Charles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHARLES the 1st\\r\\n\\r\\nThis amiable Monarch seems born to have suffered misfortunes equal to\\r\\nthose of his lovely Grandmother; misfortunes which he could not deserve\\r\\nsince he was her descendant. Never certainly were there before so many\\r\\ndetestable Characters at one time in England as in this Period of its\\r\\nHistory; never were amiable men so scarce. The number of them throughout\\r\\nthe whole Kingdom amounting only to FIVE, besides the inhabitants\\r\\nof Oxford who were always loyal to their King and faithful to his\\r\\ninterests. The names of this noble five who never forgot the duty of\\r\\nthe subject, or swerved from their attachment to his Majesty, were as\\r\\nfollows--The King himself, ever stedfast in his own support--Archbishop\\r\\nLaud, Earl of Strafford, Viscount Faulkland and Duke of Ormond, who were\\r\\nscarcely less strenuous or zealous in the cause. While the VILLIANS\\r\\nof the time would make too long a list to be written or read; I shall\\r\\ntherefore content myself with mentioning the leaders of the Gang.\\r\\nCromwell, Fairfax, Hampden, and Pym may be considered as the original\\r\\nCausers of all the disturbances, Distresses, and Civil Wars in which\\r\\nEngland for many years was embroiled. In this reign as well as in that\\r\\nof Elizabeth, I am obliged in spite of my attachment to the Scotch,\\r\\nto consider them as equally guilty with the generality of the English,\\r\\nsince they dared to think differently from their Sovereign, to forget\\r\\nthe Adoration which as STUARTS it was their Duty to pay them, to rebel\\r\\nagainst, dethrone and imprison the unfortunate Mary; to oppose, to\\r\\ndeceive, and to sell the no less unfortunate Charles. The Events of this\\r\\nMonarch's reign are too numerous for my pen, and indeed the recital\\r\\nof any Events (except what I make myself) is uninteresting to me; my\\r\\nprincipal reason for undertaking the History of England being to Prove\\r\\nthe innocence of the Queen of Scotland, which I flatter myself with\\r\\nhaving effectually done, and to abuse Elizabeth, tho' I am rather\\r\\nfearful of having fallen short in the latter part of my scheme.--As\\r\\ntherefore it is not my intention to give any particular account of the\\r\\ndistresses into which this King was involved through the misconduct and\\r\\nCruelty of his Parliament, I shall satisfy myself with vindicating him\\r\\nfrom the Reproach of Arbitrary and tyrannical Government with which he\\r\\nhas often been charged. This, I feel, is not difficult to be done, for\\r\\nwith one argument I am certain of satisfying every sensible and well\\r\\ndisposed person whose opinions have been properly guided by a good\\r\\nEducation--and this Argument is that he was a STUART.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinis Saturday Nov: 26th 1791.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA COLLECTION OF LETTERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Miss COOPER\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUSIN Conscious of the Charming Character which in every Country, and\\r\\nevery Clime in Christendom is Cried, Concerning you, with Caution and\\r\\nCare I Commend to your Charitable Criticism this Clever Collection\\r\\nof Curious Comments, which have been Carefully Culled, Collected and\\r\\nClassed by your Comical Cousin\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Author.\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA COLLECTION OF LETTERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the FIRST From a MOTHER to her FREIND.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Children begin now to claim all my attention in different Manner from\\r\\nthat in which they have been used to receive it, as they are now arrived\\r\\nat that age when it is necessary for them in some measure to become\\r\\nconversant with the World, My Augusta is 17 and her sister scarcely a\\r\\ntwelvemonth younger. I flatter myself that their education has been such\\r\\nas will not disgrace their appearance in the World, and that THEY will\\r\\nnot disgrace their Education I have every reason to beleive. Indeed they\\r\\nare sweet Girls--. Sensible yet unaffected--Accomplished yet Easy--.\\r\\nLively yet Gentle--. As their progress in every thing they have learnt\\r\\nhas been always the same, I am willing to forget the difference of age,\\r\\nand to introduce them together into Public. This very Evening is fixed\\r\\non as their first ENTREE into Life, as we are to drink tea with Mrs Cope\\r\\nand her Daughter. I am glad that we are to meet no one, for my Girls\\r\\nsake, as it would be awkward for them to enter too wide a Circle on the\\r\\nvery first day. But we shall proceed by degrees.--Tomorrow Mr Stanly's\\r\\nfamily will drink tea with us, and perhaps the Miss Phillips's will meet\\r\\nthem. On Tuesday we shall pay Morning Visits--On Wednesday we are to\\r\\ndine at Westbrook. On Thursday we have Company at home. On Friday we\\r\\nare to be at a Private Concert at Sir John Wynna's--and on Saturday\\r\\nwe expect Miss Dawson to call in the Morning--which will complete my\\r\\nDaughters Introduction into Life. How they will bear so much dissipation\\r\\nI cannot imagine; of their spirits I have no fear, I only dread their\\r\\nhealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis mighty affair is now happily over, and my Girls are OUT. As the\\r\\nmoment approached for our departure, you can have no idea how the sweet\\r\\nCreatures trembled with fear and expectation. Before the Carriage drove\\r\\nto the door, I called them into my dressing-room, and as soon as they\\r\\nwere seated thus addressed them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Girls the moment is now\\r\\narrived when I am to reap the rewards of all my Anxieties and Labours\\r\\ntowards you during your Education. You are this Evening to enter a World\\r\\nin which you will meet with many wonderfull Things; Yet let me warn\\r\\nyou against suffering yourselves to be meanly swayed by the Follies and\\r\\nVices of others, for beleive me my beloved Children that if you do--I\\r\\nshall be very sorry for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They both assured me that they would ever\\r\\nremember my advice with Gratitude, and follow it with attention; That\\r\\nthey were prepared to find a World full of things to amaze and to shock\\r\\nthem: but that they trusted their behaviour would never give me reason\\r\\nto repent the Watchful Care with which I had presided over their infancy\\r\\nand formed their Minds--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith such expectations and such intentions\\r\\n(cried I) I can have nothing to fear from you--and can chearfully\\r\\nconduct you to Mrs Cope's without a fear of your being seduced by her\\r\\nExample, or contaminated by her Follies. Come, then my Children (added\\r\\nI) the Carriage is driving to the door, and I will not a moment delay\\r\\nthe happiness you are so impatient to enjoy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When we arrived at\\r\\nWarleigh, poor Augusta could scarcely breathe, while Margaret was all\\r\\nLife and Rapture. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe long-expected Moment is now arrived (said she)\\r\\nand we shall soon be in the World.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--In a few Moments we were in Mrs\\r\\nCope's parlour, where with her daughter she sate ready to receive us.\\r\\nI observed with delight the impression my Children made on them--. They\\r\\nwere indeed two sweet, elegant-looking Girls, and tho' somewhat abashed\\r\\nfrom the peculiarity of their situation, yet there was an ease in their\\r\\nManners and address which could not fail of pleasing--. Imagine my\\r\\ndear Madam how delighted I must have been in beholding as I did, how\\r\\nattentively they observed every object they saw, how disgusted with some\\r\\nThings, how enchanted with others, how astonished at all! On the whole\\r\\nhowever they returned in raptures with the World, its Inhabitants, and\\r\\nManners. Yrs Ever--A. F.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the SECOND From a YOUNG LADY crossed in Love to her freind\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy should this last disappointment hang so heavily on my spirits? Why\\r\\nshould I feel it more, why should it wound me deeper than those I\\r\\nhave experienced before? Can it be that I have a greater affection for\\r\\nWilloughby than I had for his amiable predecessors? Or is it that our\\r\\nfeelings become more acute from being often wounded? I must suppose my\\r\\ndear Belle that this is the Case, since I am not conscious of being more\\r\\nsincerely attached to Willoughby than I was to Neville, Fitzowen, or\\r\\neither of the Crawfords, for all of whom I once felt the most lasting\\r\\naffection that ever warmed a Woman's heart. Tell me then dear Belle why\\r\\nI still sigh when I think of the faithless Edward, or why I weep when I\\r\\nbehold his Bride, for too surely this is the case--. My Freinds are all\\r\\nalarmed for me; They fear my declining health; they lament my want\\r\\nof spirits; they dread the effects of both. In hopes of releiving my\\r\\nmelancholy, by directing my thoughts to other objects, they have invited\\r\\nseveral of their freinds to spend the Christmas with us. Lady Bridget\\r\\nDarkwood and her sister-in-law, Miss Jane are expected on Friday; and\\r\\nColonel Seaton's family will be with us next week. This is all most\\r\\nkindly meant by my Uncle and Cousins; but what can the presence of a\\r\\ndozen indefferent people do to me, but weary and distress me--. I will\\r\\nnot finish my Letter till some of our Visitors are arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriday Evening Lady Bridget came this morning, and with her, her sweet\\r\\nsister Miss Jane--. Although I have been acquainted with this charming\\r\\nWoman above fifteen Years, yet I never before observed how lovely she\\r\\nis. She is now about 35, and in spite of sickness, sorrow and Time is\\r\\nmore blooming than I ever saw a Girl of 17. I was delighted with her,\\r\\nthe moment she entered the house, and she appeared equally pleased with\\r\\nme, attaching herself to me during the remainder of the day. There is\\r\\nsomething so sweet, so mild in her Countenance, that she seems more than\\r\\nMortal. Her Conversation is as bewitching as her appearance; I could not\\r\\nhelp telling her how much she engaged my admiration--. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Miss Jane\\r\\n(said I)--and stopped from an inability at the moment of expressing\\r\\nmyself as I could wish--Oh! Miss Jane--(I repeated)--I could not think\\r\\nof words to suit my feelings--She seemed waiting for my speech--. I\\r\\nwas confused--distressed--my thoughts were bewildered--and I could only\\r\\nadd--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She saw and felt for my Embarrassment and with\\r\\nadmirable presence of mind releived me from it by saying--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear\\r\\nSophia be not uneasy at having exposed yourself--I will turn the\\r\\nConversation without appearing to notice it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! how I loved her for\\r\\nher kindness!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Do you ride as much as you used to do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she--. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nam advised to ride by my Physician. We have delightful Rides round us,\\r\\nI have a Charming horse, am uncommonly fond of the Amusement, replied\\r\\nI quite recovered from my Confusion, and in short I ride a great deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are in the right my Love,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. Then repeating the following\\r\\nline which was an extempore and equally adapted to recommend both Riding\\r\\nand Candour--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRide where you may, Be Candid where you can,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I rode once,\\r\\nbut it is many years ago--She spoke this in so low and tremulous a\\r\\nVoice, that I was silent--. Struck with her Manner of speaking I could\\r\\nmake no reply. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not ridden, continued she fixing her Eyes on my\\r\\nface, since I was married.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I was never so surprised--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarried, Ma'am!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n I repeated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may well wear that look of astonishment, said she,\\r\\nsince what I have said must appear improbable to you--Yet nothing is\\r\\nmore true than that I once was married.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen why are you called Miss Jane?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI married, my Sophia without the consent or knowledge of my father the\\r\\nlate Admiral Annesley. It was therefore necessary to keep the secret\\r\\nfrom him and from every one, till some fortunate opportunity might offer\\r\\nof revealing it--. Such an opportunity alas! was but too soon given in\\r\\nthe death of my dear Capt. Dashwood--Pardon these tears, continued Miss\\r\\nJane wiping her Eyes, I owe them to my Husband's memory. He fell my\\r\\nSophia, while fighting for his Country in America after a most happy\\r\\nUnion of seven years--. My Children, two sweet Boys and a Girl, who\\r\\nhad constantly resided with my Father and me, passing with him and with\\r\\nevery one as the Children of a Brother (tho' I had ever been an only\\r\\nChild) had as yet been the comforts of my Life. But no sooner had\\r\\nI lossed my Henry, than these sweet Creatures fell sick and died--.\\r\\nConceive dear Sophia what my feelings must have been when as an Aunt I\\r\\nattended my Children to their early Grave--. My Father did not survive\\r\\nthem many weeks--He died, poor Good old man, happily ignorant to his\\r\\nlast hour of my Marriage.'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut did not you own it, and assume his name at your husband's death?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo; I could not bring myself to do it; more especially when in my\\r\\nChildren I lost all inducement for doing it. Lady Bridget, and yourself\\r\\nare the only persons who are in the knowledge of my having ever been\\r\\neither Wife or Mother. As I could not Prevail on myself to take the\\r\\nname of Dashwood (a name which after my Henry's death I could never hear\\r\\nwithout emotion) and as I was conscious of having no right to that of\\r\\nAnnesley, I dropt all thoughts of either, and have made it a point of\\r\\nbearing only my Christian one since my Father's death.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She paused--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\r\\nmy dear Miss Jane (said I) how infinitely am I obliged to you for so\\r\\nentertaining a story! You cannot think how it has diverted me! But have\\r\\nyou quite done?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have only to add my dear Sophia, that my Henry's elder Brother dieing\\r\\nabout the same time, Lady Bridget became a Widow like myself, and as we\\r\\nhad always loved each other in idea from the high Character in which we\\r\\nhad ever been spoken of, though we had never met, we determined to live\\r\\ntogether. We wrote to one another on the same subject by the same post,\\r\\nso exactly did our feeling and our actions coincide! We both eagerly\\r\\nembraced the proposals we gave and received of becoming one family, and\\r\\nhave from that time lived together in the greatest affection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd is this all? said I, I hope you have not done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed I have; and did you ever hear a story more pathetic?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never did--and it is for that reason it pleases me so much, for when\\r\\none is unhappy nothing is so delightful to one's sensations as to hear\\r\\nof equal misery.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! but my Sophia why are YOU unhappy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you not heard Madam of Willoughby's Marriage?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut my love why lament HIS perfidy, when you bore so well that of many\\r\\nyoung Men before?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! Madam, I was used to it then, but when Willoughby broke his\\r\\nEngagements I had not been dissapointed for half a year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Girl!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the THIRD From a YOUNG LADY in distressed Circumstances to her\\r\\nfreind\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days ago I was at a private Ball given by Mr Ashburnham. As my\\r\\nMother never goes out she entrusted me to the care of Lady Greville who\\r\\ndid me the honour of calling for me in her way and of allowing me to sit\\r\\nforwards, which is a favour about which I am very indifferent especially\\r\\nas I know it is considered as confering a great obligation on me \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo\\r\\nMiss Maria (said her Ladyship as she saw me advancing to the door of the\\r\\nCarriage) you seem very smart to night--MY poor Girls will appear quite\\r\\nto disadvantage by YOU--I only hope your Mother may not have distressed\\r\\nherself to set YOU off. Have you got a new Gown on?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes Ma'am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied I with as much indifference as I could assume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, and a fine one too I think--(feeling it, as by her permission I\\r\\nseated myself by her) I dare say it is all very smart--But I must\\r\\nown, for you know I always speak my mind, that I think it was quite a\\r\\nneedless piece of expence--Why could not you have worn your old striped\\r\\none? It is not my way to find fault with People because they are poor,\\r\\nfor I always think that they are more to be despised and pitied than\\r\\nblamed for it, especially if they cannot help it, but at the same time I\\r\\nmust say that in my opinion your old striped Gown would have been quite\\r\\nfine enough for its Wearer--for to tell you the truth (I always speak my\\r\\nmind) I am very much afraid that one half of the people in the room will\\r\\nnot know whether you have a Gown on or not--But I suppose you intend to\\r\\nmake your fortune to night--. Well, the sooner the better; and I wish\\r\\nyou success.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed Ma'am I have no such intention--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho ever heard a young Lady own that she was a Fortune-hunter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Miss\\r\\nGreville laughed but I am sure Ellen felt for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas your Mother gone to bed before you left her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her Ladyship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Ma'am, said Ellen it is but nine o'clock.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue Ellen, but Candles cost money, and Mrs Williams is too wise to be\\r\\nextravagant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe was just sitting down to supper Ma'am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what had she got for supper?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not observe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBread and\\r\\nCheese I suppose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should never wish for a better supper.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nEllen. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have never any reason replied her Mother, as a better is\\r\\nalways provided for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Miss Greville laughed excessively, as she\\r\\nconstantly does at her Mother's wit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch is the humiliating Situation in which I am forced to appear while\\r\\nriding in her Ladyship's Coach--I dare not be impertinent, as my Mother\\r\\nis always admonishing me to be humble and patient if I wish to make my\\r\\nway in the world. She insists on my accepting every invitation of Lady\\r\\nGreville, or you may be certain that I would never enter either her\\r\\nHouse, or her Coach with the disagreable certainty I always have of\\r\\nbeing abused for my Poverty while I am in them.--When we arrived at\\r\\nAshburnham, it was nearly ten o'clock, which was an hour and a half\\r\\nlater than we were desired to be there; but Lady Greville is too\\r\\nfashionable (or fancies herself to be so) to be punctual. The Dancing\\r\\nhowever was not begun as they waited for Miss Greville. I had not been\\r\\nlong in the room before I was engaged to dance by Mr Bernard, but just\\r\\nas we were going to stand up, he recollected that his Servant had got\\r\\nhis white Gloves, and immediately ran out to fetch them. In the mean\\r\\ntime the Dancing began and Lady Greville in passing to another room went\\r\\nexactly before me--She saw me and instantly stopping, said to me though\\r\\nthere were several people close to us,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey day, Miss Maria! What cannot you get a partner? Poor Young Lady!\\r\\nI am afraid your new Gown was put on for nothing. But do not despair;\\r\\nperhaps you may get a hop before the Evening is over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So saying, she\\r\\npassed on without hearing my repeated assurance of being engaged, and\\r\\nleaving me very much provoked at being so exposed before every one--Mr\\r\\nBernard however soon returned and by coming to me the moment he entered\\r\\nthe room, and leading me to the Dancers my Character I hope was cleared\\r\\nfrom the imputation Lady Greville had thrown on it, in the eyes of all\\r\\nthe old Ladies who had heard her speech. I soon forgot all my vexations\\r\\nin the pleasure of dancing and of having the most agreable partner in\\r\\nthe room. As he is moreover heir to a very large Estate I could see that\\r\\nLady Greville did not look very well pleased when she found who had been\\r\\nhis Choice--She was determined to mortify me, and accordingly when we\\r\\nwere sitting down between the dances, she came to me with more than her\\r\\nusual insulting importance attended by Miss Mason and said loud enough\\r\\nto be heard by half the people in the room, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray Miss Maria in what\\r\\nway of business was your Grandfather? for Miss Mason and I cannot agree\\r\\nwhether he was a Grocer or a Bookbinder.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I saw that she wanted to\\r\\nmortify me, and was resolved if I possibly could to Prevent her seeing\\r\\nthat her scheme succeeded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNeither Madam; he was a Wine Merchant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, I knew he was in some such low way--He broke did not he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nbeleive not Ma'am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid not he abscond?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never heard that he did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt least he died insolvent?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was never told so before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, was\\r\\nnot your FATHER as poor as a Rat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI fancy not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas not he in the\\r\\nKings Bench once?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never saw him there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She gave me SUCH a look, and\\r\\nturned away in a great passion; while I was half delighted with myself\\r\\nfor my impertinence, and half afraid of being thought too saucy. As Lady\\r\\nGreville was extremely angry with me, she took no further notice of\\r\\nme all the Evening, and indeed had I been in favour I should have been\\r\\nequally neglected, as she was got into a Party of great folks and she\\r\\nnever speaks to me when she can to anyone else. Miss Greville was with\\r\\nher Mother's party at supper, but Ellen preferred staying with the\\r\\nBernards and me. We had a very pleasant Dance and as Lady G--slept all\\r\\nthe way home, I had a very comfortable ride.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day while we were at dinner Lady Greville's Coach stopped at\\r\\nthe door, for that is the time of day she generally contrives it should.\\r\\nShe sent in a message by the servant to say that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe should not get out\\r\\nbut that Miss Maria must come to the Coach-door, as she wanted to speak\\r\\nto her, and that she must make haste and come immediately--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat an\\r\\nimpertinent Message Mama!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo Maria--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied she--Accordingly\\r\\nI went and was obliged to stand there at her Ladyships pleasure though\\r\\nthe Wind was extremely high and very cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy I think Miss Maria you are not quite so smart as you were last\\r\\nnight--But I did not come to examine your dress, but to tell you that\\r\\nyou may dine with us the day after tomorrow--Not tomorrow, remember, do\\r\\nnot come tomorrow, for we expect Lord and Lady Clermont and Sir Thomas\\r\\nStanley's family--There will be no occasion for your being very fine\\r\\nfor I shant send the Carriage--If it rains you may take an umbrella--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n I could hardly help laughing at hearing her give me leave to keep myself\\r\\ndry--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd pray remember to be in time, for I shant wait--I hate my\\r\\nVictuals over-done--But you need not come before the time--How does\\r\\nyour Mother do? She is at dinner is not she?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes Ma'am we were in the\\r\\nmiddle of dinner when your Ladyship came.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid you find it very\\r\\ncold Maria.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ellen. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, it is an horrible East wind--said her\\r\\nMother--I assure you I can hardly bear the window down--But you are used\\r\\nto be blown about by the wind Miss Maria and that is what has made your\\r\\nComplexion so rudely and coarse. You young Ladies who cannot often ride\\r\\nin a Carriage never mind what weather you trudge in, or how the wind\\r\\nshews your legs. I would not have my Girls stand out of doors as you do\\r\\nin such a day as this. But some sort of people have no feelings either\\r\\nof cold or Delicacy--Well, remember that we shall expect you on Thursday\\r\\nat 5 o'clock--You must tell your Maid to come for you at night--There\\r\\nwill be no Moon--and you will have an horrid walk home--My compts to\\r\\nYour Mother--I am afraid your dinner will be cold--Drive on--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And away\\r\\nshe went, leaving me in a great passion with her as she always does.\\r\\nMaria Williams.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the FOURTH From a YOUNG LADY rather impertinent to her freind\\r\\n\\r\\nWe dined yesterday with Mr Evelyn where we were introduced to a very\\r\\nagreable looking Girl his Cousin. I was extremely pleased with her\\r\\nappearance, for added to the charms of an engaging face, her manner and\\r\\nvoice had something peculiarly interesting in them. So much so, that\\r\\nthey inspired me with a great curiosity to know the history of her Life,\\r\\nwho were her Parents, where she came from, and what had befallen her,\\r\\nfor it was then only known that she was a relation of Mr Evelyn, and\\r\\nthat her name was Grenville. In the evening a favourable opportunity\\r\\noffered to me of attempting at least to know what I wished to know, for\\r\\nevery one played at Cards but Mrs Evelyn, My Mother, Dr Drayton, Miss\\r\\nGrenville and myself, and as the two former were engaged in a whispering\\r\\nConversation, and the Doctor fell asleep, we were of necessity obliged\\r\\nto entertain each other. This was what I wished and being determined not\\r\\nto remain in ignorance for want of asking, I began the Conversation in\\r\\nthe following Manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you been long in Essex Ma'am?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI arrived on Tuesday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou came from Derbyshire?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, Ma'am! appearing surprised at my question, from Suffolk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d You will\\r\\nthink this a good dash of mine my dear Mary, but you know that I am not\\r\\nwanting for Impudence when I have any end in veiw. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you pleased with\\r\\nthe Country Miss Grenville? Do you find it equal to the one you have\\r\\nleft?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMuch superior Ma'am in point of Beauty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She sighed. I longed to know\\r\\nfor why.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the face of any Country however beautiful said I, can be but a poor\\r\\nconsolation for the loss of one's dearest Freinds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She shook her\\r\\nhead, as if she felt the truth of what I said. My Curiosity was so much\\r\\nraised, that I was resolved at any rate to satisfy it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou regret having left Suffolk then Miss Grenville?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed I do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou were born there I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes Ma'am I was and passed many happy\\r\\nyears there--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a great comfort--said I--I hope Ma'am that you never spent any\\r\\nunhappy one's there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerfect Felicity is not the property of Mortals, and no one has a right\\r\\nto expect uninterrupted Happiness.--Some Misfortunes I have certainly\\r\\nmet with.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWHAT Misfortunes dear Ma'am? replied I, burning with impatience to know\\r\\nevery thing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNONE Ma'am I hope that have been the effect of any wilfull\\r\\nfault in me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say not Ma'am, and have no doubt but that any\\r\\nsufferings you may have experienced could arise only from the cruelties\\r\\nof Relations or the Errors of Freinds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She sighed--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou seem unhappy\\r\\nmy dear Miss Grenville--Is it in my power to soften your Misfortunes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYOUR power Ma'am replied she extremely surprised; it is in NO ONES\\r\\npower to make me happy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She pronounced these words in so mournfull and\\r\\nsolemn an accent, that for some time I had not courage to reply. I\\r\\nwas actually silenced. I recovered myself however in a few moments and\\r\\nlooking at her with all the affection I could, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Miss Grenville\\r\\nsaid I, you appear extremely young--and may probably stand in need of\\r\\nsome one's advice whose regard for you, joined to superior Age, perhaps\\r\\nsuperior Judgement might authorise her to give it. I am that person, and\\r\\nI now challenge you to accept the offer I make you of my Confidence and\\r\\nFreindship, in return to which I shall only ask for yours--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are extremely obliging Ma'am--said she--and I am highly flattered\\r\\nby your attention to me--But I am in no difficulty, no doubt, no\\r\\nuncertainty of situation in which any advice can be wanted. Whenever I\\r\\nam however continued she brightening into a complaisant smile, I shall\\r\\nknow where to apply.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI bowed, but felt a good deal mortified by such a repulse; still however\\r\\nI had not given up my point. I found that by the appearance of sentiment\\r\\nand Freindship nothing was to be gained and determined therefore to\\r\\nrenew my attacks by Questions and suppositions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you intend staying\\r\\nlong in this part of England Miss Grenville?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes Ma'am, some time I beleive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut how will Mr and Mrs Grenville bear your absence?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are neither of them alive Ma'am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This was an answer I did not\\r\\nexpect--I was quite silenced, and never felt so awkward in my Life---.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER the FIFTH From a YOUNG LADY very much in love to her Freind\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Uncle gets more stingy, my Aunt more particular, and I more in love\\r\\nevery day. What shall we all be at this rate by the end of the year! I\\r\\nhad this morning the happiness of receiving the following Letter from my\\r\\ndear Musgrove.\\r\\n\\r\\nSackville St: Janry 7th It is a month to day since I first beheld my\\r\\nlovely Henrietta, and the sacred anniversary must and shall be kept in\\r\\na manner becoming the day--by writing to her. Never shall I forget the\\r\\nmoment when her Beauties first broke on my sight--No time as you well\\r\\nknow can erase it from my Memory. It was at Lady Scudamores. Happy Lady\\r\\nScudamore to live within a mile of the divine Henrietta! When the lovely\\r\\nCreature first entered the room, oh! what were my sensations? The sight\\r\\nof you was like the sight ofa wonderful fine Thing. I started--I gazed\\r\\nat her with admiration--She appeared every moment more Charming, and the\\r\\nunfortunate Musgrove became a captive to your Charms before I had time\\r\\nto look about me. Yes Madam, I had the happiness of adoring you, an\\r\\nhappiness for which I cannot be too grateful. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat said he to himself\\r\\nis Musgrove allowed to die for Henrietta? Enviable Mortal! and may he\\r\\npine for her who is the object of universal admiration, who is adored\\r\\nby a Colonel, and toasted by a Baronet! Adorable Henrietta how beautiful\\r\\nyou are! I declare you are quite divine! You are more than Mortal.\\r\\nYou are an Angel. You are Venus herself. In short Madam you are the\\r\\nprettiest Girl I ever saw in my Life--and her Beauty is encreased in her\\r\\nMusgroves Eyes, by permitting him to love her and allowing me to hope.\\r\\nAnd ah! Angelic Miss Henrietta Heaven is my witness how ardently I do\\r\\nhope for the death of your villanous Uncle and his abandoned Wife, since\\r\\nmy fair one will not consent to be mine till their decease has placed\\r\\nher in affluence above what my fortune can procure--. Though it is an\\r\\nimprovable Estate--. Cruel Henrietta to persist in such a resolution! I\\r\\nam at Present with my sister where I mean to continue till my own house\\r\\nwhich tho' an excellent one is at Present somewhat out of repair, is\\r\\nready to receive me. Amiable princess of my Heart farewell--Of that\\r\\nHeart which trembles while it signs itself Your most ardent Admirer and\\r\\ndevoted humble servt. T. Musgrove.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a pattern for a Love-letter Matilda! Did you ever read such\\r\\na master-piece of Writing? Such sense, such sentiment, such purity of\\r\\nThought, such flow of Language and such unfeigned Love in one sheet?\\r\\nNo, never I can answer for it, since a Musgrove is not to be met with\\r\\nby every Girl. Oh! how I long to be with him! I intend to send him the\\r\\nfollowing in answer to his Letter tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dearest Musgrove--. Words cannot express how happy your Letter made\\r\\nme; I thought I should have cried for joy, for I love you better than\\r\\nany body in the World. I think you the most amiable, and the handsomest\\r\\nMan in England, and so to be sure you are. I never read so sweet a\\r\\nLetter in my Life. Do write me another just like it, and tell me you are\\r\\nin love with me in every other line. I quite die to see you. How shall\\r\\nwe manage to see one another? for we are so much in love that we cannot\\r\\nlive asunder. Oh! my dear Musgrove you cannot think how impatiently I\\r\\nwait for the death of my Uncle and Aunt--If they will not Die soon, I\\r\\nbeleive I shall run mad, for I get more in love with you every day of my\\r\\nLife.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow happy your Sister is to enjoy the pleasure of your Company in her\\r\\nhouse, and how happy every body in London must be because you are there.\\r\\nI hope you will be so kind as to write to me again soon, for I never\\r\\nread such sweet Letters as yours. I am my dearest Musgrove most truly\\r\\nand faithfully yours for ever and ever Henrietta Halton.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope he will like my answer; it is as good a one as I can write\\r\\nthough nothing to his; Indeed I had always heard what a dab he was at\\r\\na Love-letter. I saw him you know for the first time at Lady\\r\\nScudamores--And when I saw her Ladyship afterwards she asked me how I\\r\\nliked her Cousin Musgrove?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy upon my word said I, I think he is a very handsome young Man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad you think so replied she, for he is distractedly in love with\\r\\nyou.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLaw! Lady Scudamore said I, how can you talk so ridiculously?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay, t'is very true answered she, I assure you, for he was in love with\\r\\nyou from the first moment he beheld you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish it may be true said I, for that is the only kind of love I\\r\\nwould give a farthing for--There is some sense in being in love at first\\r\\nsight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I give you Joy of your conquest, replied Lady Scudamore, and\\r\\nI beleive it to have been a very complete one; I am sure it is not a\\r\\ncontemptible one, for my Cousin is a charming young fellow, has seen a\\r\\ngreat deal of the World, and writes the best Love-letters I ever read.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis made me very happy, and I was excessively pleased with my conquest.\\r\\nHowever, I thought it was proper to give myself a few Airs--so I said to\\r\\nher--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is all very pretty Lady Scudamore, but you know that we young\\r\\nLadies who are Heiresses must not throw ourselves away upon Men who have\\r\\nno fortune at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Miss Halton said she, I am as much convinced of that as you can\\r\\nbe, and I do assure you that I should be the last person to encourage\\r\\nyour marrying anyone who had not some pretensions to expect a fortune\\r\\nwith you. Mr Musgrove is so far from being poor that he has an estate of\\r\\nseveral hundreds an year which is capable of great Improvement, and an\\r\\nexcellent House, though at Present it is not quite in repair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf that is the case replied I, I have nothing more to say against\\r\\nhim, and if as you say he is an informed young Man and can write a\\r\\ngood Love-letter, I am sure I have no reason to find fault with him\\r\\nfor admiring me, tho' perhaps I may not marry him for all that Lady\\r\\nScudamore.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are certainly under no obligation to marry him answered her\\r\\nLadyship, except that which love himself will dictate to you, for if I\\r\\nam not greatly mistaken you are at this very moment unknown to yourself,\\r\\ncherishing a most tender affection for him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLaw, Lady Scudamore replied I blushing how can you think of such a\\r\\nthing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause every look, every word betrays it, answered she; Come my dear\\r\\nHenrietta, consider me as a freind, and be sincere with me--Do not you\\r\\nprefer Mr Musgrove to any man of your acquaintance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray do not ask me such questions Lady Scudamore, said I turning away\\r\\nmy head, for it is not fit for me to answer them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay my Love replied she, now you confirm my suspicions. But why\\r\\nHenrietta should you be ashamed to own a well-placed Love, or why refuse\\r\\nto confide in me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not ashamed to own it; said I taking Courage. I do not refuse to\\r\\nconfide in you or blush to say that I do love your cousin Mr Musgrove,\\r\\nthat I am sincerely attached to him, for it is no disgrace to love a\\r\\nhandsome Man. If he were plain indeed I might have had reason to be\\r\\nashamed of a passion which must have been mean since the object would\\r\\nhave been unworthy. But with such a figure and face, and such beautiful\\r\\nhair as your Cousin has, why should I blush to own that such superior\\r\\nmerit has made an impression on me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy sweet Girl (said Lady Scudamore embracing me with great affection)\\r\\nwhat a delicate way of thinking you have in these matters, and what a\\r\\nquick discernment for one of your years! Oh! how I honour you for such\\r\\nNoble Sentiments!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you Ma'am said I; You are vastly obliging. But pray Lady Scudamore\\r\\ndid your Cousin himself tell you of his affection for me I shall like\\r\\nhim the better if he did, for what is a Lover without a Confidante?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my Love replied she, you were born for each other. Every word\\r\\nyou say more deeply convinces me that your Minds are actuated by the\\r\\ninvisible power of simpathy, for your opinions and sentiments so exactly\\r\\ncoincide. Nay, the colour of your Hair is not very different. Yes my\\r\\ndear Girl, the poor despairing Musgrove did reveal to me the story of\\r\\nhis Love--. Nor was I surprised at it--I know not how it was, but I had\\r\\na kind of presentiment that he would be in love with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, but how did he break it to you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was not till after supper. We were sitting round the fire\\r\\ntogether talking on indifferent subjects, though to say the truth the\\r\\nConversation was cheifly on my side for he was thoughtful and silent,\\r\\nwhen on a sudden he interrupted me in the midst of something I was\\r\\nsaying, by exclaiming in a most Theatrical tone--\\r\\n\\r\\nYes I'm in love I feel it now And Henrietta Halton has undone me\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! What a sweet way replied I, of declaring his Passion! To make such\\r\\na couple of charming lines about me! What a pity it is that they are not\\r\\nin rhime!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very glad you like it answered she; To be sure there was a great\\r\\ndeal of Taste in it. And are you in love with her, Cousin? said I. I am\\r\\nvery sorry for it, for unexceptionable as you are in every respect, with\\r\\na pretty Estate capable of Great improvements, and an excellent House\\r\\ntho' somewhat out of repair, yet who can hope to aspire with success\\r\\nto the adorable Henrietta who has had an offer from a Colonel and\\r\\nbeen toasted by a Baronet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTHAT I have--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried I. Lady Scudamore\\r\\ncontinued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh dear Cousin replied he, I am so well convinced of the\\r\\nlittle Chance I can have of winning her who is adored by thousands, that\\r\\nI need no assurances of yours to make me more thoroughly so. Yet surely\\r\\nneither you or the fair Henrietta herself will deny me the exquisite\\r\\nGratification of dieing for her, of falling a victim to her Charms. And\\r\\nwhen I am dead\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--continued her--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh Lady Scudamore, said I wiping my eyes, that such a sweet Creature\\r\\nshould talk of dieing!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is an affecting Circumstance indeed, replied Lady Scudamore.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen\\r\\nI am dead said he, let me be carried and lain at her feet, and perhaps\\r\\nshe may not disdain to drop a pitying tear on my poor remains.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Lady Scudamore interrupted I, say no more on this affecting\\r\\nsubject. I cannot bear it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! how I admire the sweet sensibility of your Soul, and as I would not\\r\\nfor Worlds wound it too deeply, I will be silent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray go on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I. She did so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then added he, Ah! Cousin imagine what my transports will be when\\r\\nI feel the dear precious drops trickle on my face! Who would not die\\r\\nto haste such extacy! And when I am interred, may the divine Henrietta\\r\\nbless some happier Youth with her affection, May he be as tenderly\\r\\nattached to her as the hapless Musgrove and while HE crumbles to dust,\\r\\nMay they live an example of Felicity in the Conjugal state!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you ever hear any thing so pathetic? What a charming wish, to be\\r\\nlain at my feet when he was dead! Oh! what an exalted mind he must have\\r\\nto be capable of such a wish! Lady Scudamore went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! my dear Cousin replied I to him, such noble behaviour as this, must\\r\\nmelt the heart of any woman however obdurate it may naturally be;\\r\\nand could the divine Henrietta but hear your generous wishes for her\\r\\nhappiness, all gentle as is her mind, I have not a doubt but that she\\r\\nwould pity your affection and endeavour to return it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Cousin\\r\\nanswered he, do not endeavour to raise my hopes by such flattering\\r\\nassurances. No, I cannot hope to please this angel of a Woman, and the\\r\\nonly thing which remains for me to do, is to die.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue Love is ever\\r\\ndesponding replied I, but I my dear Tom will give you even greater\\r\\nhopes of conquering this fair one's heart, than I have yet given you, by\\r\\nassuring you that I watched her with the strictest attention during the\\r\\nwhole day, and could plainly discover that she cherishes in her bosom\\r\\nthough unknown to herself, a most tender affection for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Lady Scudamore cried I, This is more than I ever knew!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid not I say that it was unknown to yourself? I did not, continued\\r\\nI to him, encourage you by saying this at first, that surprise might\\r\\nrender the pleasure still Greater.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo Cousin replied he in a languid\\r\\nvoice, nothing will convince me that I can have touched the heart of\\r\\nHenrietta Halton, and if you are deceived yourself, do not attempt\\r\\ndeceiving me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn short my Love it was the work of some hours for me to\\r\\nPersuade the poor despairing Youth that you had really a preference for\\r\\nhim; but when at last he could no longer deny the force of my arguments,\\r\\nor discredit what I told him, his transports, his Raptures, his Extacies\\r\\nare beyond my power to describe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! the dear Creature, cried I, how passionately he loves me! But dear\\r\\nLady Scudamore did you tell him that I was totally dependant on my Uncle\\r\\nand Aunt?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I told him every thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what did he say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe exclaimed with virulence against Uncles and Aunts; Accused the laws\\r\\nof England for allowing them to Possess their Estates when wanted by\\r\\ntheir Nephews or Neices, and wished HE were in the House of Commons,\\r\\nthat he might reform the Legislature, and rectify all its abuses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! the sweet Man! What a spirit he has!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe could not flatter himself he added, that the adorable Henrietta\\r\\nwould condescend for his sake to resign those Luxuries and that splendor\\r\\nto which she had been used, and accept only in exchange the Comforts\\r\\nand Elegancies which his limited Income could afford her, even supposing\\r\\nthat his house were in Readiness to receive her. I told him that it\\r\\ncould not be expected that she would; it would be doing her an injustice\\r\\nto suppose her capable of giving up the power she now possesses and so\\r\\nnobly uses of doing such extensive Good to the poorer part of her fellow\\r\\nCreatures, merely for the gratification of you and herself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure said I, I AM very Charitable every now and then. And what\\r\\ndid Mr Musgrove say to this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe replied that he was under a melancholy necessity of owning the truth\\r\\nof what I said, and that therefore if he should be the happy Creature\\r\\ndestined to be the Husband of the Beautiful Henrietta he must bring\\r\\nhimself to wait, however impatiently, for the fortunate day, when she\\r\\nmight be freed from the power of worthless Relations and able to bestow\\r\\nherself on him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a noble Creature he is! Oh! Matilda what a fortunate one I am, who\\r\\nam to be his Wife! My Aunt is calling me to come and make the pies, so\\r\\nadeiu my dear freind, and beleive me yours etc--H.

Though you have often told me that Miss Millar was remarkably\\r\\nhandsome, you never mentioned anything of her Sisters' beauty; yet they\\r\\nare certainly extremely pretty. I'll give you their description.--Julia\\r\\nis eighteen; with a countenance in which Modesty, Sense and Dignity are\\r\\nhappily blended, she has a form which at once presents you with Grace,\\r\\nElegance and Symmetry. Charlotte who is just sixteen is shorter than her\\r\\nSister, and though her figure cannot boast the easy dignity of\\r\\nJulia's, yet it has a pleasing plumpness which is in a different way as\\r\\nestimable. She is fair and her face is expressive sometimes of softness\\r\\nthe most bewitching, and at others of Vivacity the most striking.\\r\\nShe appears to have infinite Wit and a good humour unalterable; her\\r\\nconversation during the half hour they set with us, was replete with\\r\\nhumourous sallies, Bonmots and repartees; while the sensible, the\\r\\namiable Julia uttered sentiments of Morality worthy of a heart like her\\r\\nown. Mr Millar appeared to answer the character I had always received\\r\\nof him. My Father met him with that look of Love, that social Shake, and\\r\\ncordial kiss which marked his gladness at beholding an old and valued\\r\\nfreind from whom thro' various circumstances he had been separated\\r\\nnearly twenty years. Mr Millar observed (and very justly too) that\\r\\nmany events had befallen each during that interval of time, which gave\\r\\noccasion to the lovely Julia for making most sensible reflections on the\\r\\nmany changes in their situation which so long a period had occasioned,\\r\\non the advantages of some, and the disadvantages of others. From\\r\\nthis subject she made a short digression to the instability of human\\r\\npleasures and the uncertainty of their duration, which led her to\\r\\nobserve that all earthly Joys must be imperfect. She was proceeding to\\r\\nillustrate this doctrine by examples from the Lives of great Men when\\r\\nthe Carriage came to the Door and the amiable Moralist with her Father\\r\\nand Sister was obliged to depart; but not without a promise of spending\\r\\nfive or six months with us on their return. We of course mentioned you,\\r\\nand I assure you that ample Justice was done to your Merits by all.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLouisa Clarke (said I) is in general a very pleasant Girl, yet\\r\\nsometimes her good humour is clouded by Peevishness, Envy and Spite. She\\r\\nneither wants Understanding or is without some pretensions to Beauty,\\r\\nbut these are so very trifling, that the value she sets on her personal\\r\\ncharms, and the adoration she expects them to be offered are at once a\\r\\nstriking example of her vanity, her pride, and her folly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So said I,\\r\\nand to my opinion everyone added weight by the concurrence of their own.\\r\\nYour affectionate Arabella Smythe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FIRST ACT OF A COMEDY\\r\\n\\r\\nCHARACTERS Popgun Maria Charles Pistolletta Postilion Hostess Chorus of\\r\\nploughboys Cook and                      and\\r\\nStrephon Chloe\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE--AN INN\\r\\n\\r\\nENTER Hostess, Charles, Maria, and Cook.\\r\\n\\r\\nHostess to Maria) If the gentry in the Lion should want beds, shew them\\r\\nnumber 9.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaria) Yes Mistress.--EXIT Maria\\r\\n\\r\\nHostess to Cook) If their Honours in the Moon ask for the bill of fare,\\r\\ngive it them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCook) I wull, I wull.

But I will pawn to you an\\r\\nundirected Letter that I received from Chloe.\\r\\n\\r\\nPost:) Sir, I accept your offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nEND OF THE FIRST ACT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA LETTER from a YOUNG LADY, whose feelings being too strong for\\r\\nher Judgement led her into the commission of Errors which her Heart\\r\\ndisapproved.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany have been the cares and vicissitudes of my past life, my beloved\\r\\nEllinor, and the only consolation I feel for their bitterness is that on\\r\\na close examination of my conduct, I am convinced that I have strictly\\r\\ndeserved them. I murdered my father at a very early period of my Life, I\\r\\nhave since murdered my Mother, and I am now going to murder my Sister. I\\r\\nhave changed my religion so often that at present I have not an idea of\\r\\nany left. I have been a perjured witness in every public tryal for these\\r\\nlast twelve years; and I have forged my own Will. In short there is\\r\\nscarcely a crime that I have not committed--But I am now going to\\r\\nreform. Colonel Martin of the Horse guards has paid his Addresses to me,\\r\\nand we are to be married in a few days. As there is something singular\\r\\nin our Courtship, I will give you an account of it. Colonel Martin is\\r\\nthe second son of the late Sir John Martin who died immensely rich, but\\r\\nbequeathing only one hundred thousand pound apeice to his three younger\\r\\nChildren, left the bulk of his fortune, about eight Million to the\\r\\npresent Sir Thomas. Upon his small pittance the Colonel lived tolerably\\r\\ncontented for nearly four months when he took it into his head to\\r\\ndetermine on getting the whole of his eldest Brother's Estate. A new\\r\\nwill was forged and the Colonel produced it in Court--but nobody would\\r\\nswear to it's being the right will except himself, and he had sworn so\\r\\nmuch that Nobody beleived him. At that moment I happened to be passing\\r\\nby the door of the Court, and was beckoned in by the Judge who told the\\r\\nColonel that I was a Lady ready to witness anything for the cause of\\r\\nJustice, and advised him to apply to me. In short the Affair was soon\\r\\nadjusted. The Colonel and I swore to its' being the right will, and Sir\\r\\nThomas has been obliged to resign all his illgotten wealth. The Colonel\\r\\nin gratitude waited on me the next day with an offer of his hand--. I am\\r\\nnow going to murder my Sister. Yours Ever, Anna Parker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA TOUR THROUGH WALES--in a LETTER from a YOUNG LADY--\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Dear Clara I have been so long on the ramble that I have not till now\\r\\nhad it in my power to thank you for your Letter--. We left our dear home\\r\\non last Monday month; and proceeded on our tour through Wales, which is\\r\\na principality contiguous to England and gives the title to the Prince\\r\\nof Wales. We travelled on horseback by preference. My Mother rode upon\\r\\nour little poney and Fanny and I walked by her side or rather ran, for\\r\\nmy Mother is so fond of riding fast that she galloped all the way. You\\r\\nmay be sure that we were in a fine perspiration when we came to our\\r\\nplace of resting. Fanny has taken a great many Drawings of the Country,\\r\\nwhich are very beautiful, tho' perhaps not such exact resemblances\\r\\nas might be wished, from their being taken as she ran along. It would\\r\\nastonish you to see all the Shoes we wore out in our Tour. We determined\\r\\nto take a good Stock with us and therefore each took a pair of our own\\r\\nbesides those we set off in. However we were obliged to have them both\\r\\ncapped and heelpeiced at Carmarthen, and at last when they were quite\\r\\ngone, Mama was so kind as to lend us a pair of blue Sattin Slippers, of\\r\\nwhich we each took one and hopped home from Hereford delightfully---I am\\r\\nyour ever affectionate Elizabeth Johnson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA TALE.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Gentleman whose family name I shall conceal, bought a small Cottage in\\r\\nPembrokeshire about two years ago. This daring Action was suggested to\\r\\nhim by his elder Brother who promised to furnish two rooms and a Closet\\r\\nfor him, provided he would take a small house near the borders of an\\r\\nextensive Forest, and about three Miles from the Sea. Wilhelminus gladly\\r\\naccepted the offer and continued for some time searching after such a\\r\\nretreat when he was one morning agreably releived from his suspence by\\r\\nreading this advertisement in a Newspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO BE LETT A Neat Cottage on the borders of an extensive forest and\\r\\nabout three Miles from the Sea. It is ready furnished except two rooms\\r\\nand a Closet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe delighted Wilhelminus posted away immediately to his brother, and\\r\\nshewed him the advertisement. Robertus congratulated him and sent him\\r\\nin his Carriage to take possession of the Cottage. After travelling for\\r\\nthree days and six nights without stopping, they arrived at the Forest\\r\\nand following a track which led by it's side down a steep Hill over\\r\\nwhich ten Rivulets meandered, they reached the Cottage in half an hour.\\r\\nWilhelminus alighted, and after knocking for some time without receiving\\r\\nany answer or hearing any one stir within, he opened the door which\\r\\nwas fastened only by a wooden latch and entered a small room, which he\\r\\nimmediately perceived to be one of the two that were unfurnished--From\\r\\nthence he proceeded into a Closet equally bare. A pair of stairs that\\r\\nwent out of it led him into a room above, no less destitute, and these\\r\\napartments he found composed the whole of the House. He was by no means\\r\\ndispleased with this discovery, as he had the comfort of reflecting that\\r\\nhe should not be obliged to lay out anything on furniture himself--. He\\r\\nreturned immediately to his Brother, who took him the next day to every\\r\\nShop in Town, and bought what ever was requisite to furnish the two\\r\\nrooms and the Closet, In a few days everything was completed, and\\r\\nWilhelminus returned to take possession of his Cottage. Robertus\\r\\naccompanied him, with his Lady the amiable Cecilia and her two lovely\\r\\nSisters Arabella and Marina to whom Wilhelminus was tenderly attached,\\r\\nand a large number of Attendants.--An ordinary Genius might probably\\r\\nhave been embarrassed, in endeavouring to accomodate so large a party,\\r\\nbut Wilhelminus with admirable presence of mind gave orders for the\\r\\nimmediate erection of two noble Tents in an open spot in the Forest\\r\\nadjoining to the house. Their Construction was both simple and\\r\\nelegant--A couple of old blankets, each supported by four sticks, gave\\r\\na striking proof of that taste for architecture and that happy ease in\\r\\novercoming difficulties which were some of Wilhelminus's most striking\\r\\nVirtues.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Love And Freindship And Other Early\\r\\nWorks, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LOVE AND FREINDSHIP ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 1212-0.txt or 1212-0.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/1/1212/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\""
